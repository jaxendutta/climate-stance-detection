wu9zny,The r/climatechange Verified User Flair Program,"r/climatechange is a community centered around science and technology related to climate change. As such, it can be often be beneficial to distinguish educated/informed opinions from general comments, and verified user flairs are an easy way to accomplish this. 

# Do I qualify for a user flair?

As is the case in almost any science related field, a college degree (or current pursuit of one) is required to obtain a flair. Users in the community can apply for a flair by emailing [**redditclimatechangeflair@gmail.com**](mailto:redditclimatechangeflair@gmail.com) with information that corroborates the verification claim.

**The email must include:**

1. At least one of the following: A verifiable .edu/.gov/etc email address, a picture of a diploma or business card, a screenshot of course registration, or other verifiable information.
2. The reddit username stated in the email or shown in the photograph.
3. The desired flair: **Degree Level/Occupation | Degree Area | Additional Info**  (see below)

# What will the user flair say?

In the verification email, please specify the desired flair information. A flair has the following form:

>USERNAME    **Degree Level/Occupation | Degree area | Additional Info**

For example if reddit user ‚ÄúJane‚Äù has a PhD in Atmospheric Science with a specialty in climate modeling, Jane can request:

>Flair text: PhD | Atmospheric Science | Climate Modeling

If ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù works as an electrical engineer designing wind turbines, he could request:

>Flair text: Electrical Engineer | Wind Turbines

Other examples:

>Flair Text: PhD | Marine Science | Marine Microbiology
>  
>Flair Text: Grad Student | Geophysics | Permafrost Dynamics
>  
>Flair Text: Undergrad | Physics  
>  
>Flair Text: BS | Computer Science | Risk Estimates

Note: The information used to verify the flair claim does not have to corroborate the specific additional information, but rather the broad degree area. (i.e. ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù above would only have to show he is an electrical engineer, but not that he works specifically on wind turbines).

# A note on information security

While it is encouraged that the verification email includes no sensitive information, we recognize that this may not be easy or possible for each situation. Therefore, the verification email is only accessible by a limited number of moderators, and emails are deleted after verification is completed. If you have any information security concerns, please feel free to reach out to the mod team or refrain from the verification program entirely.

# A note on the conduct of verified users

Flaired users will be held to higher standards of conduct. This includes both the technical information  provided to the community, as well as the general conduct when interacting with other users. The moderation team does hold the right to remove flairs at any time for any circumstance, especially if the user does not adhere to the professionalism and courtesy expected of flaired users. Even if qualified, you are not entitled to a user flair.

# Thanks

Thanks to r/fusion for providing the model of this Verified User Flair Program, and to u/AsHotAsTheClimate for suggesting it.",40,20,2022-08-21 16:53:23,en

The older I get (I‚Äôm 30) the more I get vivid nightmares of climate change completely destroying civilisation. Every week in Australia we are experiencing record breaking weather events and it just makes me think. 

I imagine the world in an eternal storm, seasons flipped, wind destroying buildings, torrential rains, blistering heat. All affecting our crops, buildings and life as we know it. 

So many people have immigrated to Australia, we don‚Äôt have enough housing. We pillage the earth for precious metals and oil but we don‚Äôt have enough for our own construction consumption. Not enough wood for new buildings. Our produce farms aren‚Äôt compatible with much of the weather, soon we‚Äôll have no chocolate, no coffee beans. Coffees are already $6 on average, it will soon become something for the wealthy.

1f525e8,A simple thought that can help,"Today I was in my balcony and looked at our pothos , she is really beautiful. Our balcony is a bit isolated from direct sunlight,we tried planting different plants but all of them died except for the pothos and she keeps on putting out new leaves , I took some cuttings and placed them in three different pots , what was just 5 leaves is 50 leaves today , it definitely has some impact on the environment but that impact is extremely negligible , but it won't be when a thousand people do it or even a million , it's all about collective effort ,Imagine a million people plant a single cutting and one day that cutting could be 50 million leaves and it's really simple , u just need to take a cutting , put it in water for a few weeks or place it in a pot or you can just leave it in water and it will still happily grow ,u dont even need direct sunlight for it , indirect sunlight would do the job or even artificial light, it will grow well and if u provide it a support it will grow bigger leaves , imagine a billion people doing this, this could bring that positive change , 

Imagine placing this plant in those barren empty lands of Australia, they could produce a lot of giant leaves with fenastration, if provided the water or just solar panels as the sunlight there is extremely harsh 

  
Overall this idea may not be an original one , or even a helpful one but I just wanted to tell people about it , I may sound dumb or stupid ,even if we do something like this , it may not create that much difference as much as i am exaggerating it to be and climate change is a complex problem that won't be solved by pothos( we could consider monsteras as well) , we also need to protect the diversity of the ecosystem but I believe it's better to have 5 leaves than none at all ,it will always be a good thing , if you give that corner of your room some life",6,1,2024-08-30 14:16:49,en

This article has some good maps and an easy search for how much hotter to expect your county to be. I did find the maps a little confusing, since one shows the Midwest and parts of the NE as having the most substantial warming, and then another map farther down showing the greatest increase in additional days with temps over 90 being in the Southeast. 

I guess it is because the bottom map is not by percentage. So if Maine only has 4 days over 90 now and increases to 5 days, that's only a 1 day increase. If Georgia has 90 days over 90 now and increases to 110, that's 20 days. Took me a few minutes to figure that out though. ",76,48,2024-08-29 14:50:34,en

1f32hit,Why are the seas around Ireland cooling as the North Atlantic SST warms?,"https://preview.redd.it/5sep93boccld1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2276bc7ce8f04c324eafd69e8e8fc047766a72f

I recently read a couple of papers on the AMOC collapsing this century, maybe even as soon as 2037. Im not a climate scientist but I am good at analysing data.

So I looked at the sea surface temperature just off the coast where I am - Ireland.

This year in Ireland, summer has felt cooler than other years.

I downloaded the NOAA data and examined an area off the west coast: 50¬∞N to 55¬∞N, 15¬∞W to 10¬∞W. Sea surface temperatures for the North Atlantic have hit record highs over the past 2 years. So when I looked at the region off Ireland, unsurprisingly, 2023 was the warmest.

But 2024 from about mid May dips down below the 1983 to 2011 mean. It's the red line in this image.

Could this be an early indicator that the AMOC weakening is cooling the waters around Ireland? Or is this far too simplistic an analysis?

1f3r8ne,Climate Denial,"Frequently I see people refer to climate deniers. I want to point out that climate beliefs are quite complex and people can not be divided into 2 groups, believers and deniers. Some aspects... 

1. Is climate change happening? It is, and always has done for many millions of years. Over the last 600 million years, CO2 has gone from 300ppm to 6000ppm back to 300ppm up to 2000ppm back to 300 ppm again and finally up to 420ppm quite rapidly. Temperature has also varied considerably having been 10 degrees warmer than present and lots colder also. We have recently (about 12,000 years ago) come out of an ice age but we are still in the very cold period as regards the long term. 

2. Are temperature and CO2 correlated? Yes they are, and tend to move up and down together. Over the recent ice age periods it is found that temperature changes PRECEDE CO2 changes by about 800 years. Over recent shorter time periods temperature changes still precede CO2 changes. I know if no research that contradicts this. This is a complex process and many contradictory explanations are given. 

3. Do humans emit large quantities of CO2? Yes, and it has been increasing rapidly over the period of human industrial activity. This is not a contentious area. 

4. How much do humans affect climate change? This is a contentious area and a large number of people believe that they know how to control the climate and that is mainly by reducing fossil fuel use. Three times there have been reductions in fossil fuel use, in the 1970s oil shocks, following the 2008 stock market crash and when covid caused lock downs. So we have an example of how effective reducing fossil fuel use is. It actually has no effect on the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere! Surprisingly, burning less fossil fuels does not even slightly reduce the the rate at which CO2 levels are increasing. 

5. Is global warming happening everywhere? It is happening much more in cities than in the country side. That is because of more tarmac and more also energy use in cities. Every use of fuels produces heat. This is called Urban Heat Island effect. In America it has been estimated that it amounts to 7 F or 4 C. That is many times more than the predicted effects of climate change. So it is very important to get this right. Some studies have shown that separating weather stations into urban and rural gives two averages, one increasing rapidly and the other more or less constant. It is claimed that this effect is removed from weather records. However the adjustments are often done in the opposite direction. 

6. Are disasters happening because of climate change? No, disasters happen because of bad weather events and these have always happened from time to time. Long term records show no trend to more disasters. 

7. Are there any benefits to warming and more CO2? Yes, they cause crops to grow faster and greening of deserts to happen. World wide more people die from the cold than the heat. Most people choose to go to warmer places for their holidays. 

8. Will warming lead to mass extinctions in the near future? No. Most of the species that people say will go extinct have been around for tens of millions of years and already experienced far higher temperatures back then. That is not to say that humans are not causing a mass extinction, because we are. We are wiping out forests and other habitats at an insane rate. In the last 3 decades, there has been a reduction of 90% in insect populations, and that includes bees and other pollinators. That will cause crops to fail and be a major threat to humans. 

9. Are people in this sub reddit aware of these different aspects? My observation is that they are not. They just automatically down vote anything that hints at denial of any aspect of climate change without understanding what they are doing. Please do your own research and question how you got your beliefs and discuss before down voting. ",0,35,2024-08-28 22:10:11,en

I am looking at reducing food waste while travelling, and while you may ask what does that have to do with climate change, let me explain in a succinct way. 

When we waste food, they end up in the landfill (if it hasn't been donated / converted to animal feed / etc). This produces methane which is rather harmful for the environment.

Why don't we incinerate? Because that produces harmful gas, that also contributes to climate change.

By reducing the waste we produce, we reduce the amount of pollution we are creating. Food is part of the waste, and I am interested in the travel aspect because I see that a lot, especially in planes, at the end of the trip.

1f2btdy,Can Individual Actions Truly Reverse Climate Change and Environmental Degradation?,"How much of a difference can I make to reverse the impact of climate change and minimize environmental degradation? 

I was asked this by a friend the other day, and the question has been spinning in my head ever since. 

I believe that each of us can do our part, but how effective can our solitary efforts really be? 

Here‚Äôs the answer I gave in the moment:

Collective action starts with individual choices, and even small steps can contribute to broader change. It's indeed important to recognize that the most significant impacts often come from those in positions of power, such as politicians, corporate leaders, and billionaires, whose decisions can shape policy and influence entire industries.

Given this reality, one of the most impactful actions we can take as individuals is to support and vote for leaders who are committed to addressing climate change and promoting sustainable practices. Now this isn‚Äôt easy either. 

Take the USA for example. The Democratic party is the one that takes this issue seriously, and campaigns on it. However, a Republican party controlled state, Texas, is leading the country in renewable energy production.  (not here to promote anyone, just mentioning)

The nuances of politics and policy are complex, and it‚Äôs crucial to stay informed and engaged beyond just voting, by supporting policies, initiatives, and organizations that push for meaningful environmental change.

Beyond the political sphere, there are practical steps you can take in your daily life to reduce your environmental footprint. This includes actions like donating to reforestation projects, buying second hand instead of new, reducing energy consumption, and supporting companies with sustainable practices. 

Every step counts, just as every misstep counts. Which is why it‚Äôs important to prioritize harm reduction as well.

I didn't open the message yet, so I haven't read the article for the moment.

During your thesis you were congratulated for your scientific rigor which did not fall into the trap of correlation / cause and precisely there is no study which establishes the causality of human CO2 activity and global warming ... and yet the IPCC has widely passed this idea ... which has not however prevented the German ecologists from restarting coal-fired power stations instead of nuclear power while this generates a lot of pollution: let's fight against CO2 pollution which kills  48,000 people per year in France, rather than blaming the population on global warming""

1ex7ata,Roles of Earth‚Äôs Albedo Variations and Top-of-the-Atmosphere Energy Imbalance in Recent Warming: New Insights from Satellite and Surface Observations,"Analogous to the famous ‚Äúfollow-the-money‚Äù approach often adopted by the social and political sciences to explain human behavior and social movements, this study can be described as a ‚Äúfollow-the-energy‚Äù journey to investigate the causes of recent climate warming.

These findings call for a fundamental reconsideration of the current paradigm of understanding about climate change and related socio-economic initiatives aimed at drastic reductions of industrial carbon emissions at all costs. An important aspect of this paradigm shift should be the prioritized allocation of funds to support large-scale interdisciplinary research into the physical mechanisms controlling the Earth‚Äôs albedo and cloud physics, for these are the real drivers of climate on multidecadal time scales.

The IPCC AR6 Working Group I (WG1) concluded that well-mixed greenhouse gases were ‚Äúvery likely the main driver of tropospheric warming since 1979‚Äù [1]. However, Chapter 7 of the IPCC AR6 WG1 Contribution did not take into proper consideration the observed increase of solar radiation absorption by Earth in recent decades known as ‚Äúglobal brightening‚Äù [2] (Section 7.2.2.3). The Report did not analyze the decrease of Earth‚Äôs shortwave reflectance evident in the CERES EBAF dataset over the past 20 years and its impact on GSAT. Published studies agree that the observed decrease of planetary albedo and the associated increase of solar-energy uptake by the planet must have had a significant impact on the global temperature. However, there has been no attempts thus far to quantify the actual effect of this solar forcing on GSAT. We tried to bridge this knowledge gap by developing a novel, non-statistical process model from First Principles that explicitly relates changes in TSI and albedo to global temperature anomalies. The model (Equation (16)) was derived from independent NASA planetary observations and basic rules of calculus without using Earth-specific data, greenhouse-gas radiative forcing, or positive (amplifying) feedbacks. Our goal was to verify the above IPCC AR6 conclusion by assessing the direct effect of measured changes in TSI and Earth‚Äôs sunlight absorption on the 21st-century global surface warming as documented by 6 temperature datasets.

Our analysis revealed that the solar forcing (i.e., TSI and albedo changes) measured by CERES explain 100% of the observed global warming trend and 83% of the interannual GSAT variability over the past 24 years (Figure 9), including the extreme 2023 heat anomaly (Figure 10). Albedo changes were found to be by far the dominant GSAT driver, while TSI variations only played a minor, modulating role (Figure 11 and Figure 12). The sustained increase of sunlight absorption by the planet was also identified as the most likely driver of ocean warming in recent decades based on a high correlation (R2 = 0.8) between the shortwave radiation uptake and the mean annual temperature anomaly of the 0‚Äì100 m global oceanic layer (Figure 8). These results suggest a lack of physical reality to both the anthropogenic radiative forcing attributed to rising greenhouse gases and the positive (amplifying) feedbacks hypothesized by the greenhouse theory and simulated by climate models. This is because any real forcing (or amplifying feedback) outside of the increased planetary uptake of solar radiation would have produced additional warming above and beyond the amount explained by changes in the planetary albedo and TSI. However, no such extra warming is observed in the available temperature records. Hence, the anthropogenic radiative forcing and associated positive feedbacks are likely model artifacts rather than real phenomena. The empirical data and model calculations analyzed in our study also indicate that the Earth‚Äôs climate sensitivity to radiative forcing is only 0.29‚Äì0.30 K/(W m‚àí2). Therefore, the greenhouse theory overestimates this parameter by 56‚Äì158%.

The lack of evidence for heat trapping by greenhouse gases in the climate system during the 21st Century raises an important question about the physical nature of the Earth‚Äôs Energy Imbalance (EEI). The latter is defined as the difference between the absorbed shortwave and outgoing LW flux at the TOA. EEI has been observed and calculated by various monitoring platforms for several decades. This index became a research focus in climate science during the past 15 years, because it has been perceived as evidence of anthropogenic heat accumulation (energy retention) in the Earth system that would commit the World to a prolonged future warming, even after human carbon emissions have reached a net-zero level. As a result of such a view, EEI is now called the ‚Äúmost fundamental indicator for climate change‚Äù [33]. However, our analysis of observed data, model calculations, and standard thermodynamic theory showed that EEI has been misinterpreted by the science community, since it arises from adiabatic dissipation of thermal energy in ascending air parcels in the troposphere due to a decreasing atmospheric pressure with height (see discussion in Section 4). Hence, integrating EEI over space and time in an effort to calculate some total ‚Äúenergy gain‚Äù by the Earth system, as done by researchers in recent years, is physically misleading, because EEI includes energy that was adiabatically lost to the system during the convective cooling process. Our analyses also showed that this energy imbalance results from a varying sunlight absorption by the planet and would only disappear if the Earth‚Äôs albedo stops changing and the uptake of shortwave radiation stabilizes, which is unlikely to ever occur. The reduction of human greenhouse-gas emissions cannot and will not affect EEI. Nevertheless, the Earth has gained a considerable amount of thermal energy over the past 45 years due to a sustained increase of shortwave-radiation uptake, which is a completely different mechanism from the theorized trapping of radiant heat by greenhouse gases, since it does not involve a hidden energy storage.",2,66,2024-08-20 17:16:45,en

1exj88g,"Why is one of the easiest changes regarding climate change being ignored and another simple, but very expensive solution?","A simple solution to drastically reduce climate change is to increase the planet's overall reflection. How can we do that? By simply painting whatever we can white and avoid especially darker colors...

The majority of cars have darker colors. Even if their exterior is white the interior is always darker than white and sun always gets inside.

I know that many people hate white and it's obvious why - too easy to see dirt/spots on it and in general it's not a stylish color like black (<3), but if our future well being depends on it I find it a dumb excuse. Why are new cars not charged extra CO2 credits when they are not in white color and contribute more to the global warming instead of brighter cars? I don't have a car, but if I had a choice I wouldn't mind it being white and having more comfort in the summer days.

Not only that but having everything white would make interior buildings cooler as well, so it's a general convenience to everyone! It would reduce the electricity bills too.

A very expensive solution to global warming is to launch a space mirror or construct it in space. It doesn't have to be huge. It just needs to be close to the sun to cast a major shadow on our planet. A clever way would be to have multiple smaller mirrors in order not to impact the climate and nature too much. This should be far bigger priority than the silly Mars colonization of Elon Musk!

1evk6ge,"Another Outer Banks Home Collapses Into Ocean, a Stark Reminder of Climate Change","In Rodanthe, N.C., seven homes have been lost to the ocean in the last four years, as rising sea levels erode shorelines and put more buildings at risk.


In North Carolina, climate change has caused the sea level to rise by about half a foot since 2000, and the level could rise by about another foot by 2050, said William Sweet, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.


Rodanthe, located on Hatteras Island, is home to many oceanfront properties with elevated houses sitting on pilings that were once surrounded by dunes and dry sand. Now, that land is often partially or fully covered by water, which erodes the sand around the pilings that support the homes, creating the risk of a collapse.


Officials said that residents facing the threat of home collapse have limited ‚Äî and largely unappealing ‚Äî options.

They can move their home to drier ground, a costly and logistically complicated process that is not always feasible. They can pay to have their home demolished. Or, they can wait until the home collapses and then seek reimbursement through insurance, if covered.

A stunning streak of global record warmth is now 14 months long, according to the agency;""  ""not a lot of difference in Atlantic hurricane activity between La Ni√±a and neutral conditions""","[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/08/noaa-july-2024-was-earths-hottest-month-on-record/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/08/noaa-july-2024-was-earths-hottest-month-on-record/)

Jeff Masters and Bob Henson are two of the nation's leading hurricane experts.

Buried in the article is a significant observation that was news to me:

<<El Ni√±o conditions tend to suppress Atlantic hurricane activity through an increase in wind shear, but La Ni√±a conditions tend to have the opposite effect. There‚Äôs not a lot of difference in Atlantic hurricane activity between La Ni√±a and neutral conditions.>>

The first sentence is common knowledge for individuals who follow hurricane projections.  I've never before seen, to my memory, the observation in the second sentence.

A forecast emergence of La Nina conditions, along with record ocean heat content, has formed the basis for forecasts of at least a near record hurricane season in 2024, as explained in this recently updated NOAA 2024 hurricane season forecast.

<<Highly active hurricane season likely to continue in the Atlantic

Near-record sea surface temperatures and the possibility of La Nina are key factors>>

[https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/highly-active-hurricane-season-likely-to-continue-in-atlantic](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/highly-active-hurricane-season-likely-to-continue-in-atlantic)

The failure of La Nina conditions to emerge perhaps have led some to believe that the expected severe hurricane season for 2024 might be avoided.  The NOAA recently revised hurricane forecast for a severe hurricane season is little changed from its initial May forecast, despite the failure of La Nina conditions to yet emerge.  The NOAA revised forecast didn't specifically address the critical point that neutral ENSO (see link at end of post) conditions, already in effect, aren't much different than La Nina conditions in impacting hurricane development.

If Masters and Henson are correct, which would appear highly likely given their expertise and the failure of NOAA to condition its revised forecast on the emergence of La Nina conditions, that there is ""not a lot of difference in Atlantic hurricane activity between La Nina and neutral conditions,"" it would appear the next few months may yet experience severe hurricane activity in hurricane-prone regions of the U.S.

A key observation buried in the revised NOAA hurricane forecast:

<<Of note, the dry Saharan air that prevented tropical storm development during portions of the middle of the summer is expected to subside in August.¬†>>

Masters and Henson discuss current ENSO forecasts in their July heat report:

<<The 2023-24¬†[El Ni√±o event](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2023/12/how-will-el-nino-affect-the-u-s-this-winter/)¬†in the Eastern Pacific ended during May, and neutral conditions are now in place, NOAA reported in its latest¬†[monthly discussion](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.shtml)¬†of the state of the El Ni√±o/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. La Ni√±a is still projected to prevail during 2024-25, but the slower-than-expected pace of development thus far has chipped away slightly at the probabilities in the most recent forecasts.

According to the official NOAA probabilistic forecast¬†[issued August 8](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/figure07.gif), which is based on expert judgment drawing from observations and model data, there is now a 50% chance of La Ni√±a conditions developing by August-September-October. These odds are down from the 70% odds for the same period given in the forecast¬†issued in July.>>

From a May 31 Masters and Henson article analyzing the 2024 hurricane season outlook:

<<**Bob:** I would submit also perhaps a better-than-usual chance of a late hurricane with La Ni√±a conditions really settling in. La Ni√±a years can often have some really bad late hurricanes.¬†

**Jeff:** That‚Äôs a good point. The end of the season could be more active than the early part of the season in that regard.

**Bob:** That was the case in 2020, when we went all the way into the supplementary names.>>

[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/05/jeff-masters-and-bob-henson-give-us-the-low-down-on-the-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/05/jeff-masters-and-bob-henson-give-us-the-low-down-on-the-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season/)

If La Nina and neutral ENSO conditions don't impact hurricane formation much differently, are La Nina conditions necessary to fulfill this forecast of late season hurricane activity?

1eua9lk,I am worried about my future.,"Idk if this will get aproved or not, I just want to take some weight out of my body. I will probably delete this account in a week or so.

I am a young person (19yo) from Argentina who lived in a middle sized city 17 years of my life, and I am deeply worried. I just started reading deeply (at least that's what I guess) about CC around a month ago and I feel very hopeless, perhaps desperate, perhaps distressed, Idk, I watched some James Hansen paper presentations, reading a bit about Simon Michaux, heard the interview that Nate Hansen did to William Rees, read some articles of the LtG paper and it's updates, read some presentations about MIT books. All of those things built up the stress in my body regarding the possble collapse of Modern Human Civilization and I don't know what to do. I talked to my psychologist about this and she told me to stop reading so many negative news, that it's just the media that's trying to get people to read them for ads. Idk if that's true when I am the one actively seeking them out.

I study physics in part thanks to sci-fi and my grandfather. He is a massive fan of space, UFOs, physics and Carl Sagan, always telling me about how intelligent and wise he was. How he dreamed about this massive space exploration and settlement ideas, how he and his team convinced the USA and USSR from not destroying the world with nukes. The idea of a galaxy rise. I felt sad and hopeless when I saw his speech in the 80s in front of the US congress talking about climate change and Assimov's speech in American Humanist Association. If the smartest and wisest people I know of couldn't convince the world to do something, who could?

After this month I was left looking through many subs and interviews a sort of light at the end of the tunnel. Nothing, at least in my view. Some coments and questions I have read: 

-""If society were to collapse, would we return to our current prosperity and technological levels at some point?"" A: ""No because we have mined all easy access ores and energy sources in this planet so you wouldn't unless you have the required technologies and energy which you won't get anyway because of lowering EROI""

-""At least after the extinction of humanity the planet will recover"". 

-""Oh well, humanity was always a plage/cancer cell/parasite/plague to the planet anyway""

-""You are living in the end of the high prosperity times. Enjoy it while it lasts""

I feel like I can't accept this coments because of how many good people I have met and made friends with. How many of them are alive thanks to modern medicine. Even when I went to college in a big city, the people there helped me and guided me. Where to go, where not to go, what to do, how it's done and so on. All of that made me have faith in humanity and it's empathy. Am I just doomed to see them and myself die if society collpases? Because let's be honest, at least me, I don't have any of the skills, tools nor emotions to survive such scenario, I would most likely curl in a ball and die at some point.

I could always turn around and see the progress we have made so far but I honestly don't want to fool myself because at least in my college, if you have a score of 1/10 in a test it's called **insufficient**. Having a president and an appointed head of the national science comission say that climate change isn't real doesn't makes me more relaxed. Neither does the fact that many of the people I listed are not talking about whether people somewhere will suffer or not but rather about whether we will survive or not. My obsession problem has reached a point where I can even identiify certain ""doomer"" users and actively avoid reading their comments because I don't want to be even more burried in sadness.

I am no man for politics. Yes, I had my phase where I tried to get into it and swinged between ideologies as fast as the ""I am 16 and I want to get into politics"" video until falling back into undesided but even in that phase, when I saw kids and adults march and discuss about politics, I just shruged and thought ""that's for the adults to do. Like voting, drinking and marring today"". So Idk what to do. I am trying to reduce meat consumption to as low as I reasonably can for a person with no education in nutrition and I talked to my father about Climate Change. Funnily enough, he just shruged the same way I did and said something along the lines of: ""We can't know everything in the world, much less worry. That's why we have specialists. To listen to their recomendations and follow their orders"". So yeah, that's all. Thanks for reading if you did.",110,188,2024-08-17 01:29:45,en

1ev5kin,Forests are not carbon sinks.,"Why are forests carbon sinks? We‚Äôve been told repeatedly as children that forests are carbon sinks. It made sense back in 6th grade because trees spit out less carbon dioxide than they take in. But that carbon has to go somewhere, no? Either into the soil or into the tree. Given this, it would make sense that even for a singular tree, its carbon emissions would approach its storage rate as the tree grows older and its growth rate slows. We‚Äôre also forgetting that trees die. When a tree dies in an established forest, that carbon has to go somewhere. Either into the soil or into the atmosphere through the decomposition process. My point is that if old growth forests were carbon sinks, we would see them increase in size over time or the carbon in the system would increase (more c in soil, more squirrels over time, etc). But what we see is a dynamic equilibrium. No matter what happens, there‚Äôs some negative feedback in the system that accounts for it.  That‚Äôs what makes these forests ‚Äúold growth‚Äù. I want to be wrong, but I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm missing. The only semi dangerous assumption I seem to be making is that these ecosystems don‚Äôt change slowly over millennia.

1etyq7t,Why is increased CO2 emission bad if the atmosphere is already opaque...,"Atmospheric absorption charts I have seen seem to say that the atmosphere is already opaque at most of the infrared absorption wavelengths for CO2: 2.7 microns, 4.25, 14-15, but not for 2 microns (and the 2 micron wavelength seems to me to reradiate more from the sun than the earth, so net cooling). So why do climate scientists say we need to reduce our CO2 emissions? Why would more CO2 cause more greenhouse heating if the atmosphere is already opaque?  I assume temperature is rising due to earth's present energy imbalance at recent decades' level of CO2 and methane... that we're not at steady state yet. I don't see that more CO2 changes the final steady state.

  
Is it that more CO2 means higher concentration in the lower atmosphere and this increases heating even if the air column is opaque?

  
I am not a climate denier. I am an engineer trying to understand enough to discuss with a friend and I don't want to say anything obviously stupid and easily shot down.

I understand that CO2 stays in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years.

  
I understand we should reduce methane emissions and that the atmosphere is not opaque at methane's wavelength.

I'm trying to figure out what I want to do with my life.
I want to learn more about the environment and climate change to see if it's a career path to pursue.

Could anyone recommend any science based books to read that could teach me the basics on different areas of environmental issues and main causes behind them.

I understand that climate change is to do with rising carbon in the atmosphere which causes the planet to heat up which causes issues, but I don't really know specifically what the issues are etc 

Any recommendations would be great.

I‚Äôve been diving into some research on systemic change and how we can tackle big issues like climate change and inequality. There are some fascinating initiatives out there that are trying to make a real difference, so far I found these interesting but I‚Äôd like to get to know more (found these mostly on linkedin).

* **The Transition Towns movement**¬†(https://transitionnetwork.org/): This initiative focuses on building stronger, more resilient communities. I love how it emphasizes local action and community resilience, which feels really empowering.
* **The Ellen MacArthur Foundation**¬†(https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/): They are pushing for a circular economy to reduce waste and make better use of resources. The idea of designing out waste and keeping products in use is something that really resonates with me.
* **The Green Standard Trust** (https://www.gstdao.com): This seems to be a new kind of land trust that combines capitalism with philanthropy by backing cryptocurrency with land. It seems like a unique way to rethink how we value our planet and sounds bold! I‚Äôm intrigued by how this could potentially align economic incentives with environmental preservation.
* **The B Corporation movement**¬†(https://www.bcorporation.net): They certify companies that meet high social and environmental standards. I appreciate how this movement is transforming the business landscape by holding companies accountable to higher standards.
* **The Green New Deal**¬†(https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal\_en): This is a big policy proposal aimed at tackling climate change and economic inequality together. The comprehensive approach of addressing multiple issues at once is something I find very promising.

I‚Äôm curious to hear what you all think. Have you come across any other initiatives that are actually either making a difference or that have huge potential to scale?",39,1,2024-08-08 14:48:13,en

1enha3v,CO2 in Oceans - critical factor?,"In discussions here, I continually wonder why CO2 dissolved in ocean waters isn't discussed more.  There is 60x more CO2 there than in the atmosphere, and some sources estimate even more than in all known fossil fuel deposits.

One angle is a concern of acidifying the oceans via carbonic acid.  Were all atmospheric CO2 today to be dissolved, it could increase ocean CO2 by <2%.  Could that appreciably affect acidity?  Would it hurt or help coral?  They do need carbon to grow their structure (calcium carbonate).  Much of the CO2 becomes stored in very deep water as pure liquid CO2, so might the dissolved concentration even change?

Ernst-Georg Beck was investigating a relation between atmospheric CO2 and ocean-dissolved CO2.  He thought he found a correlation between ocean events (changes in water temperature and upwelling currents) and atmospheric measurements, just before his early death from cancer.  His papers have largely been ignored by Climate Inc as ""perhaps inconvenient"".  One place to start reading: 

[https://scienceofclimatechange.org/wp-content/uploads/Yndestad-2022-Publication-of-Becks-CO2-series.pdf](https://scienceofclimatechange.org/wp-content/uploads/Yndestad-2022-Publication-of-Becks-CO2-series.pdf)

Some articles and papers which popped up in a quick google below.  I particularly like the discussion in r/askscience where replies applaud the, ""I don't know"" of a true scientist, in contrast to the constant ""what do you believe"" and ""are you a denier"" posted by many here (some notoriously troll my every reply).  The askscience question concerns if adding fresh water to the ocean from ice-melt might absorb additional atmospheric CO2, which is an interesting thought.

My opinion is that much more research in this area would be valuable, as opposed to the continual me-too research papers in journals like Nature Communications which just pile onto the anthropogenic-climate-change claims with no value-added.  But, then I'm not a funding agency.

>From the RGI, we can learn that there are **198,000** glaciers in the World. However, this is a slightly arbitrary quantity, as it depends on the quality of the digital elevation model used, mapping resolution, and the minimum-area threshold used. Most analysts use a minimum area threshold of 0.1 km2; they will not map anything smaller than this due to difficulties in distinguishing between glaciers and snowpacks. If these small glacierets are including, the number of glaciers in the World could be up to 400,000, but they would still only account for 1.4% of the World‚Äôs glacierised area.

1ehdm4n,Are the Dutch wrong? ,"Here in the Netherlands (where i am an expat), people do not seem to worry much about sea level rise. Most people i talk to say something along the lines of ""we've always figured it out and we always will."" They are failing to meet their own climate goals, failing to reduce their cow situationship (no other word for it really if we're being honest haaa). I am not aware of a settled plan/strategy for sea level rise, only 4 different"" options ""closed, open, advance, and accommodate"". But i havent heard of a commitment to a plan or action taken towards it. 

Meanwhile, there's also a massive housing crisis. Homes are getting more and more expensive. Even as the ocean rises. This seems to have zero impact on the housing market somehow. 

My family wants/needs a bigger house, but i hesitate to dump so much of our net worth into an asset that seems.... Possibly inevitability going to be literally under water. Yet, we love living among the Randstad canals...... 

Does anyone have any insights into how to think about all of this? Do the Dutch have a reason i do not see to be so comfortable and to be apparently taking their time? Is there any holistic argument to justify or rule out tieing my family's financial future to a beautiful canal-side property?

I feel very anxious for my family and torn about going forward with the life we love. Any help would be appreciated.

I'm really looking for something sober and reasonable that can help me understand what risks the country faces in the next 20, 50, and maybe 100 years given its current political and economic situation. I'm not sayingg we shouldn't think about the worst or plan international political action. But I literally can't try to decide how to build a future for my child based on those things.

We will still use trucks to carry cargo from the train station to their final destination. We can even electrify railways to further reduce emissions, assuming we use carbon free electricity. Secondly we will make electricity generation carbon free, we will use nuclear and renewable energy to achieve this. Thirdly we will decarbonize industries by electrifying light and medium industries and use green hydrogen for heavy industry. Fourthly we will stop deforestation and reforest deforestated areas. Fifthly we can make public transport more widely avaliable and used. All countries keep using fossil fuels for cars, trucks, trains, ships and airplanes.

1edk91v,"The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 900 pg pdf ""Mandate for Leadership"" quotes about climate change and the deregulation of the EPA","Here are the quotes from ""Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise"" that might concern environmentalists, along with page numbers, explanations and potential issues:

1. **Back to Basics in the EPA**:
   - **Quote**: ""EPA‚Äôs structure and mission should be greatly circumscribed to reflect the principles of cooperative federalism and limited government. This will require significant restructuring and streamlining of the agency... EPA should build earnest relationships with state and local officials and assume a more supportive role by sharing resources and expertise, recognizing that the primary role in making choices about the environment belongs to the people who live in it.""
   - **Page**: 420
   - **Explanation**: This approach suggests a reduction in the EPA's regulatory authority, shifting more responsibility to state and local governments. Historically, federal oversight has been crucial in maintaining consistent environmental standards across states, preventing a ""race to the bottom"" where states might lower standards to attract business. Reducing federal oversight could lead to less stringent environmental protections, potentially increasing pollution and environmental degradation.

2. **Reduction in EPA‚Äôs Size and Scope**:
   - **Quote**: ""Cutting EPA‚Äôs size and scope will deliver savings to the American taxpayer. Improved transparency will serve as an important check to ensure that the agency‚Äôs mission is not distorted or coopted for political gain.""
   - **Page**: 446
   - **Explanation**: The proposal to reduce the EPA's size could lead to fewer resources and less capacity to enforce environmental laws. Historically, cuts to environmental enforcement have often led to increased pollution incidents and reduced compliance with environmental regulations. This could particularly impact communities already burdened by pollution.

3. **Critical View of the EPA‚Äôs Climate Agenda**:
   - **Quote**: ""Embedded activists have sought to evade legal restraints in pursuit of a global, climate-themed agenda... The EPA under the Biden Administration has returned to the same top-down, coercive approach that defined the Obama Administration. There has been a reinstitution of unachievable standards designed to aid in the 'transition' away from politically disfavored industries and technologies and toward the Biden Administration‚Äôs preferred alternatives.""
   - **Page**: 418-419
   - **Explanation**: This criticism suggests a move away from stringent climate regulations. Historically, environmental regulations have played a crucial role in reducing emissions and mitigating climate change. Loosening these regulations could lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and hinder efforts to address global warming, exacerbating environmental problems.

4. **Energy Sector Policies**:
   - **Quote**: ""Opposition from 'Keep it in the ground' environmentalists has made it harder to gain approvals for natural gas pipelines. Under Democrat leadership, FERC has proposed official policies to consider upstream and downstream GHG emissions from the use of the natural gas that would be shipped in the pipeline to be part of FERC‚Äôs public-interest determination when deciding whether to approve a pipeline.""
   - **Page**: 407
   - **Explanation**: The resistance to considering full lifecycle emissions in pipeline approvals could lead to underestimating the environmental impact of fossil fuel infrastructure. This could result in more projects that contribute significantly to climate change being approved, counteracting efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

5. **Critique of the Biden Administration‚Äôs Environmental Policies**:
   - **Quote**: ""As a consequence of this approach, we see the return of costly, job-killing regulations that serve to depress the economy and grow the bureaucracy but do little to address, much less resolve, complex environmental problems.""
   - **Page**: 418
   - **Explanation**: Labeling environmental regulations as ""job-killing"" and bureaucratic could justify rolling back crucial protections. Historically, such rollbacks have led to increased pollution and public health issues. The focus on economic costs without addressing the long-term benefits of environmental regulations could undermine efforts to safeguard public health and ecosystems.

These quotes highlight a shift towards reducing federal environmental oversight and regulation, emphasizing economic concerns over environmental protections. This approach could lead to weakened environmental standards, potentially exacerbating pollution and climate change issues. Historically, federal environmental regulations have played a crucial role in preventing pollution and protecting public health, and reductions in these areas have often led to increased environmental degradation and health risks.

Apparently, long-term global warming trends and long-term heatwave trends are causing heatwaves in the United States and many other countries to become increasingly more frequent, increasingly more intense (hotter), and increasingly longer lasting, while the long-term trend seems to indicate that the season of summertime temperatures is arriving increasingly earlier in the year and is ending increasingly later in the year, with global average summertime temperatures rising increasingly higher each year.    
         
At the same time, the long-term trend seems to indicate that the season of wintertime temperatures is arriving increasingly later in the year and is ending increasingly earlier in the year.

However, observations over the past four decades show that near-surface water vapor has remained constant or even declined in these regions.

1eb7ous,"Suppose we ""Electrify Everything!"" What % of our current greenhouse gas emissions would still remain?","Suppose, magically, that we somehow were to electrify all power, all transportation (including aviation), and all residential, office, and industrial heat via renewable energy (i.e. the idea of ""Electrify Everything!"") tomorrow. What percentage of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of our current total would still remain?

Electrify Everything won't solve all the climate issues. That is, it won't shrink our GHG emissions down to 0.

For instance, consider cement. From what I have read, cement production is responsible for about 8% of global emissions. Part of the emissions in producing cement comes from industrial heat, namely, about 40% of cement's emissions. THAT part would go away if we were to electrify the heat with renewables somehow. But the remaining 60% of emissions from producing cement comes from the chemical process itself, in which CO2 is released as a chemical byproduct when limestone is turned into calcium oxide. So, just from cement alone, that is nearly 5% of global GHG emissions that would remain even if we electrify everything.

Or take agriculture. Cattle burps/farts release methane. I've seen estimates that this methane constitutes 4% of global GHGs. Then there is nitrous oxide produced by soil microbes acting on synthetic fertilizer spread on crops (about half of which goes unused by the crops). I've seen estimates that this nitrous oxide from fertilizers is around 3% of global GHGs. Electrifying everything won't reduce methane from cattle or nitrous oxide from excess fertilizer.

So, already with just cement, cows, and fertilizer, that is 12% of global emissions that would be wholly untouched even by a vastly successful Electrify Everything strategy. And that 12%  does not include the effects of deforestation, permafrost methane, plastics production, the industrial production of other chemicals, etc.

**Has anyone tried to put a number on what percentage of GHG emissions would still remain even if we electrify all power, transportation, and heat with renewables?**

20%? 25%? 30%?

In short, how much of our climate problem would Electrify Everything solve?

(Don't get me wrong. I'm a fan of using renewable energy to electrify as much as we can. I'm just curious how much warming will be left even if we are wildly successful with electrification.)

**EDIT:** Reddit user cybercuzco below posts a link to a World in Data chart that (as best I can tell) seems to be what I am after: https://ourworldindata.org/ghg-emissions-by-sector. If that is right, this suggests the answer to my question is that a massively successful Electrify Everything transition would (holding all else constant) eliminate around 73% of our GHG emissions and thus leave 27% of emissions unabated.",72,73,2024-07-24 13:45:44,en

1eahfmc,Methane vs CO2 -- a question.,"Methane traps more much heat than CO2; it is a much more potent greenhouse gas (GHG). But methane stays in the atmosphere much less time than CO2 does. From what I have read, methane that is released now will stay around 12 years in the atmosphere. By contrast, CO2 released now will last for much longer, namely, at least hundreds of years.

How should we weigh these different variables (namely, potency vs longevity) against each other, to get some sense of how harmful each gas overall is in terms of warming?

**For instance, suppose we could wave a magic wand and either remove 1 ton of CO2 or remove 1 ton of methane from the atmosphere. Which gas should we choose?**

If we remove methane, then we are removing the stronger GHG. That seems good! On the other hand, we are removing just 12 years worth of warming. If we remove CO2, however, we are removing hundreds of years of warming. That seems good too!

Is there a ""lifetime warming"" quantity that can be calculated for each of these tons, i.e. for CO2 and for methane? If so, then we could say, ""Let's remove the ton with the lower lifetime warming quantity."" Has this calculation been done? If so, which gas has the lower lifetime warming quantity?

(Of course, if we as a planet are near some or other tipping point within a decade or so, then it could make sense to remove the methane even if it has a lower lifetime warming effect. It could make sense to do tha tin order to prevent methane's potency -- albeit its shorter-term potency -- from pushing us over some threshold and into a harmful tipping point scenario. My guess is that that consideration might be decisive in favor of removing the 1 ton of methane instead of the 1 ton of CO2.)

*Side note 1:* I see various estimates for the longevity of atmospheric CO2. E.g. NASA says 300 to 1000 years. Other sites just say ""hundreds to thousands of years."" Why so imprecise? Do we not know CO2's longevity in the atmosphere? Or is it complicated by other factors/complexities, so that ""It depends"" is the only fair answer?

*Side note 2:* Of course, the same question (""Remove this or CO2?"") could be asked of nitrous oxide, not just methane. From what I have read, though, nitrous oxide is apparently much more potent than CO2 AND quite long-lived as well (unlike methane). So it seems an easier question, whether to remove 1 ton of CO2 or 1 ton of nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide, I assume! Even more so with fluorinated gases vs CO2. Hence, my focus in this post on methane in particular.",9,14,2024-07-23 15:59:18,en

1ea495i," The Impact of Climate and CO2 on Flora, Fauna, and Energy","Vegetation does not grow in the extreme colds found at the North and South Poles. The only wildlife that can survive in these climates relies on consuming marine life, which requires temperatures high enough to maintain liquid water. The greatest flora and fauna diversity on Earth exists in the tropics, which are the warmest and wettest non-marine environments on the planet. Increasing CO2 levels reduce the water requirements for all flora, increasing yield and available nutrition for all fauna, even in desert environments.

Heat is energy. A colder planet would not only increase global power demands, as heating homes is more energy-intensive than cooling, but would also reduce the available energy to heat homes. Heat can be turned into electricity in several ways, such as with a thermoelectric generator. Solar panels lose efficiency in colder environments, and battery performance declines in lower temperatures. Hydroelectric power obviously needs warm enough environments to keep water liquid, but it is aided by the precipitation of liquid water, which decreases when temperatures fall.

Carbon only makes up 0.025% of the Earth‚Äôs crust, while CO2 accounts for only 0.04% of the atmosphere (\~418 ppm). This means that out of roughly 2,392 molecules of air, there is just 1 molecule of CO2, and yet people think that‚Äôs too much. Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which is why ice cores drilled for historical CO2 levels will always show extremely low and consistent amounts. When water freezes, it always does so from the outer layer inward, sealing off atmospheric CO2 from getting in. CO2 is also a result of some aerobic reactions, which only take place where there is heat above the freezing point of liquid water.

Regardless of these facts, we can engineer solutions to address the challenges of global warming. However, when it comes to global cooling, there is little we can do except burn fuel and use nuclear energy.",0,6,2024-07-23 06:15:53,en

It's disgusting how mounting species decline, even extinction, is so little discussed by American politicians and even the media.  Even collapsing fisheries doesn't merit concern, or even the degradation of the national parks.

Are Florida politicians, let alone national politicians, indifferent to the destruction of the Great Florida Reef, one of the nation's great natural assets?

EDIT:  Several of the comments reinforce my point.  A majority of Americans, as evidenced by the lack of concern among politicians and media, don't seem to understand the gravity of climate change impacts on the environment, living things, and certainly mankind.  E.g., a decline in the bird population will likely increase insect populations, negatively impacting among a host of things, agricultural production unless pesticide use increases greatly.

Saw this article just recently, and wondered whether the decline in the bird population also was a factor, although much warmer winters clearly is reducing winter kill-offs of insects.

<<McDermott says the dramatic rise of tick-borne diseases in Ohio is happening for a combination of reasons.

First, there are more ticks in the state.

Because of factors like climate change and reforestation, Ohio has more habitat for ticks than it did just a few decades ago. As a result, ticks are thriving here, McDermott said.

‚ÄúOhio is really on the forefront of tick expansion,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe went from one tick of medical importance to humans, companion animals and livestock 20 years ago, which was the American dog tick, to five nowadays, including adding two new ticks in just the last few years.‚Äù

Plus, a lot of those ticks are carrying diseases.>>

These inhibitors, available as feed additives or vaccines, disrupt methane production during digestion, offering a way to cut emissions without reducing livestock production. However, challenges include variable effectiveness, high costs, regulatory hurdles, and potential carcinogenic risks.

Methane Impact: Methane is 28 times more potent than CO2 in trapping heat and constitutes 40% of agricultural emissions, mainly from cows

Inhibitor Mechanism: Methane inhibitors like 3-NOP and red seaweed interfere with enzymes that produce methane in cows, reducing emissions by 30-99%, depending on conditions.

Adoption and Investment: 3-NOP is approved in several countries and used by major dairy producers, with significant investment from biotech and agricultural companies like DSM and Cargill.",16,45,2024-07-20 09:39:36,en

Almost every day this summer has been 90F. It was not long ago that our summers were 75 and maybe a week in the 80s. Not only is it 90F but 60% humidity on a daily basis.. I understand weather fluctuates but this seems pretty extreme for such a small amount of time. In the next 10 years is 100-120F just going to be the norm? I know some places in Arizona are completely inhabitable at this point because no AC unit can combat 120F temperatures.

Edit: A big part of why I posted this is because I do home theater installs in peoples houses and for majority of this whole summer 90% of the houses I went into did not have adequate AC felt like it was 80 in the house. But besides that what about people that are unable to be in AC. I personally felt like I was close to a heat stroke multiple times during this summer. Obviously there is no quick fix and with how divided everyone is this will never get solved but I am just trying to understand or accept that this is reality now.

1e6u6he,Benefits of getting solar power panels,"Is it just me or does getting solar panels for a home sound like it will be a good idea going forward?  I'm not trying to sell solar power to anyone but I was thinking about it the other day and going, ""why aren't more people doing this?""  It's really strange because here are the pros that I can see:

* It will drive down fossil fuel use at the grid level, even if on a small, household scale
* Air conditioners will be cheaper to run on solar generated electricity
   * And the hotter it gets the more people will rely on AC in the future, making AC use probably one of the biggest expenses in electrical use going forward
* There are plenty of rebates, tax credits, and financing options
* The electrical bill won't be as high and/or as variable, and a flat, monthly financing payment would probably take its place 
* People could recharge their cars using solar-generated electricity if they chose to get an EV, which seems to be the trend

The only downsides seem to be economical/logistical

* It's a long term commitment to break even, savings wise
* They're usually more expensive out of pocket than most people can afford, which means people would probably have to finance them
* People would have to know if they're going to live in the same house over the long term if they finance solar panels
* Some people live in areas with lots of shade and not much direct sunlight

But even in the short term, just the electric bill alone would be worth it, imo.  There are companies that do ""no cost"" solar where you pay a flat monthly rate to basically ""borrow"" panels from companies who use the government incentives for themselves.

I recently stumbled upon an insightful blog post by SG Analytics on how carbon offsetting can play a crucial role in combating climate change. For anyone interested in sustainability and environmental solutions, this is a must-read! üå±

The article breaks down the concept of carbon offsetting in a very digestible way. It covers how companies and individuals can balance their carbon emissions by investing in projects that reduce or remove CO2 from the atmosphere. From reforestation initiatives to renewable energy projects, it‚Äôs fascinating to see the various ways we can contribute to a greener planet.

One point that really resonated with me was the emphasis on transparency and effectiveness in carbon offset programs. It‚Äôs not just about planting trees; it‚Äôs about ensuring these projects have a genuine, measurable impact. The blog also touches on some common misconceptions and challenges in the carbon offsetting space, which I found super enlightening.

If you‚Äôre passionate about climate change and looking for actionable ways to make a difference, I highly recommend giving this a read: [How Carbon Offsetting Can Fight Against Climate Change](https://us.sganalytics.com/blog/how-carbon-offsetting-can-fight-against-climate-change/).

If Water Vapor is the cause of the recent temperature anomalies, the temperature should revert to the mean because water vapor will precipitate out in a few years.

1dzyp2o,"Is there objective, repeatable experiments that can confirm the hypothesis of man made climate change?","I'm being serious when I ask this question.

Throughout my life, I've not believed that *man made* climate change is a reality.  All I've ever seen seems to be mainly conjecture and scary hockystick graphs that look **very** politically motivated.  I'm repeatedly told to ""trust the science"", but I hardly ever see anything that I would call science.  If I express my skepticism, I get called names like ""climate denier"", that discourse is pointless because ""we are already at consensus"", and that I am not qualified to even have an opinion because I'm not a 'climate scientist'.

Frankly this is behavior that I would expect from something like a doomsday cult.  If I went to the local university and asked for proof that say the earth was round, there are many experiments that I could be shown that are reproducible and follows the scientific method in my own home.  I could get the same thing for pretty much anything else except this.

My question is there any means by which I can verify these claims?  If it's a legitimate thing I want to know, but all I've seen so far is fear mongering and politics and frankly behavior that makes jehovah witnesses look tame.  I understand that not all experiments can be done at home and not all resources are available to a normal person with $100 budget, but surely if this is real then there's some way of me verifying this.

1dufhzf,Turbulence and air traffic,"So I got into a discussion on a forum with a ""sceptic"". (Yes, I do know what ""sceptics"" really are). They said the increased turbulence is down to the increased number of flights year on year.

A figure was published recently saying Incidents of severe turbulence increased by 55% between 1979 and 2020. However looking at the number of flights per year those have increased enormously since 1979.

The actual metric we should be looking at is the number of hours at cruising altitude but I don't see that available so number of flights is the best we have.  
I can only find figures for number of flights back to 2003.  
In 2003 approx 24 million flights, in 2023 approx 40 million.   
I can guess that 1979 was a far, far smaller figure. We hadn't even got low cost flights then. 

So the number of air miles flown is much higher, ergo of course there are more encounters with severe turbulence.  
I just want a proper argued explanation why my suggestion is wrong!

I was speaking to a person recently, and they said that they believe that our all grass system is great for the environment, and the science saying it isn't, is because it's funded by fossil fuel companies and they are playing the methane card to distract from fossil fuel emissions. I asked him if he had evidence of this conspiracy and he said know, just his gut feeling.

Scientists at the World Resources Institute and the University of Maryland calculated how devastating the impacts were of the months-long fires in Canada in 2023.... They figured it put 3.28 billion tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air, according to [a study update](https://www.wri.org/insights/canada-wildfire-emissions) published in Thursday's Global Change Biology.

The article says the land area burned was 29.951 square miles, ""six times more than the average from 2001 to 2022"" and more than the land area of West Virginia.

This land area burned by the 2023 Canadian wildfires is much less than reported last year.  E.g., NASA reported the 2023 Canadian wildfires  ""burned an estimated¬†[18.4 million hectares](https://ciffc.net/) \[more than 71 million square miles\] ‚Äîan area roughly the size of North Dakota. On average, just 2.5 million hectares burn in Canada each year.""  This higher reported land area burned would equal the land area of New York and West Virginia combined.

1drwgpo,We Launched the Largest Crowd Sourced Real-Time Global CO2 Map,"Achim from AirGradient here. I'm super excited to let you know that we have just launched the first large real-time¬†global crowd-sourced carbon dioxide map.

The data for this map comes from over 500 open-source AirGradient Open Air air quality monitors around the world, operated by engaged citizens.

The map can be accessed here:

[https://www.airgradient.com/map/](https://www.airgradient.com/map/)

It's important to know the background information and we wrote a [detailed¬†blog post](https://www.airgradient.com/blog/airgradient-global-co2-map/)¬†about it but I want to give a short summary about it here.

The aim is to detect local emission sources and then have the possibility to reduce or eliminate them. For this the pattern of the CO2 (ideally in combination with PM sources) is important to look at.

Here is a real example from a pier in Bangkok where speed boats operate from 6am to 8pm. The AirGradient monitor measures CO2 and PM2.5.

[David McKelvey from Brisbane, Australia, CC BY 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons](https://preview.redd.it/oqbavrv81o9d1.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=94e6770eea53418b82ced686c040620464d01940)

What we can see is spikes in both PM2.5¬†and CO2¬†throughout the day that match the operating hours of the boats. Furthermore, we can clearly see more spikes during the rush hours in the mornings and late afternoons.

As a next step, this data can be quantified and average pollution levels calculated. When this baseline has been created, mitgation measures can be implemented. For example, there is an initiative in Bangkok to switch to electric boats. Once this happens, the spikes should disappear, and we should clearly see the positive effects of the reduced emissions.

The open-source hardware monitors are sub USD 200 and use low-cost NDIR CO2 sensors and thus can not replace expensive reference grade monitors. However, we found them actually to be surpisingly accurate in a co-location project with the University of Cambridge. The low price has the advantage that a much denser network of monitors could be set up.

So the following use cases can be very interesting:

    ‚Ä¢ Placing a CO2¬†sensor near a busy road before and after a speed limit
    ‚Ä¢ Detecting idling cars or buses at car parks or in front of schools
    ‚Ä¢ Identifying local CO2¬†impacts from decomposition and wildfires
    ‚Ä¢ Detecting leackages in underground carbon storages
    ‚Ä¢ Identify local emission sources (e.g. power plants)

Anyway, I could write much more but will keep this announcement short. Let me know if any questions or feedback.",20,7,2024-06-30 03:59:14,en

1dpekco,Umm .... I think hospice mode makes the most sense at this point.,"Atmospheric CO2 is not a ""bad"" thing. In moderation. 

At 0 ppm, Earth would be too cold for life. 

For the last 2.5M years, up until the year 1900, CO2 levels oscillated between 160 ppm (glacial with Boston covered in ice) and 280 ppm (interglacial in which human civilization flourished over p12k years). 

The difference between 0 and 160 ppm is the difference between life and no life. 

The difference between 160 ppm and 280 ppm is the difference between glacial and interglacial. 

We have added more range (425 - 280 = 145 ppm increase) than the amount which differentiates a glacial and interglacial. 

The delayed reaction to what we have already done seems likely to doom human civilization. 

When you turn up the heat to high under a pot of water, it doesn't come to a boil immediately even though it is destined to boil out. 

The Earth is a giant pot of ocean water. Equilibrium takes decades to reach. But we have no mechanism to materially reduce CO2. The end seems inevitable absent some radical geoengineering. ",170,260,2024-06-26 20:52:16,en

1do0v8o,"""Too Late"" or not is irrelevant on this topic. Grow a pair already.","There's a lot of posts about ""why bother if it's too late?"" 

A sense of futility is a very human thing, I get that, but to me, it's irrelevant, a waste of energy and frankly unbecoming to worry about if we're ""too late"" on this topic as if that should impact our decisions. 

Doing the right thing is its own reason and its own reward, not the chance or promise of success. 

A few years back, there was a tragedy in southern Spain where a two-year-old boy fell down an illegal borehole that had just been covered up some rocks. Specialized rescue crews converged on the site and worked nonstop for days, then over a week, to try to rescue that kid. Realistically, after the first couple hours, the chance that kid was still alive plummeted but nobody there talked about quitting. They worked until they finally recovered the body, but until that moment, all of the rescue workers said, ""we have to keep hoping.""

Of course, it goes without saying the parents were feverishly hoping and praying until the end. 

Climate change is just like that. It's all our kids down that borehole, but in our case, the kids aren't nearly as far down. 

What would you think of a parent that turned and walked away and left their baby in the borehole because it was too late instead of doing everything possible, and marshaling every resource to save the kid or at least recover their body? 

Yeah, that's right. We'd all think they were a worthless piece of shit and we'd be right. ",265,171,2024-06-25 04:16:57,en

1dneley,"Realistically, what can be done to slow down climate change?","It is an issue, and I am certain that most people acknowledge it as such. But, at the same time, most people are not willing to give up on their daily rituals, activities, or vices, to slow it down. And I understand them. But what can we do? We rely heavily on hydrocarbons; they are what allowed modern society to exist in the first place. Farming, for instance, requires ammonia-based fertilizers, which in turn require hydrogen to produce it, and the cheapest solution right now is to use methane as the reactant. Vehicles require steel, and most of the steel is produced in blast furnaces as it is the cheaper solution - the alternative is an electric arc furnace, but it requires **a lot** of energy. Airplanes and ships use kerosene because the power density per meter cubed is significantly higher than any of the available battery technologies. Cement, plastics, textiles, paint, their manufacturing depend on hydrocarbons. Electric vehicles are here to save the automotive industry, not the planet; they require steel, semi-conductors, and battery manufacturing involves energy-intensive processes. Not to mention the developing countries, whose energy requirement per capita is increasing.

The way I see it is, there is no stopping it right now. Sure, we could plant more trees or be more conservative in our consumption. But the pieces are already in motion. We grew accustomed to comfort and it is difficult to give it up now. Also, companies are not willing to change to greener alternatives because they are not as efficient and are, arguably, more costly. So it is us, wanting our comforts and inexpensive alternatives, and them, wanting their profits.

I believe that the only two breakthroughs that can significantly slow it down are: modified crops that can produce their nitrogen for photosynthesis and nuclear fission. Any other solution would require EVERYONE to partake, such as lowering the meat consumption per capita, integrating more legumes in our diets, using local transportation, throwing less food and whatnot, which, unfortunately, will not happen any time soon.

1.  I'd like somewhere that *doesn't* get a lot of snow and ice.  I have cerebral palsy and I will probably *have* to use a crutch, walker or maybe even a wheelchair by my mid 60's (~ 2050).  Even today I don't do well with icy sidewalks.
2.  I'd like somewhere that won't get too hot in the summer time.  Yes I know this is in conflict with \#1.
3.  I'd like somewhere that'll have a stable water supply and isn't prone to major drought.
4.  I'd like somewhere that's *not* prone to a major disaster (earth quakes, hurricanes, rampant wildfire, etc)

Let's just say dying to a cascadia megaquake isn't on my bucket list.

I've been looking at [this map](https://i.redd.it/uc52j9cgrfc51.jpg) of us snowfall.  I expect that snowfall to shift northward with global warming, but the question is *how much*?  I know current estimates put us at warming by 2.1C by 2050, but we're already ~ 1.1C over baseline so really that's only another 1C of warming, warming is 2x over land so we're back to 2C effective warming.  I've been playing around with [this map](https://impactlab.org/map/#usmeas=absolute&usyear=2040-2059&gmeas=absolute&gyear=1986-2005&usrcp=ssp245&usvar=tasmin&usprob=0.5)

Don't think for a minute I'm minimizing the danger of climate change overall, but that doesn't shift days well below freezing by as much as I thought it would.  I question how much northward the 'rare snow' line moves?  I'd love to hear arguments against though!

My overall point is that unfortunately the PNW is off the table, and given the sheer amount of snowfall the great lakes region receives I think that's off the table too.  I'm considering eastern TN, maybe Chattanooga due to the above as well as it's fast internet and low taxes.  Where would you move in the US if you were me?

A woman waiting in line outside a food pantry, lifted her pant leg to show me a large patch of pink skin on her calf‚Äîthe scar of a second-degree burn from a fall she‚Äôd taken during a heart attack in high heat after seven years on the streets.

>It was 115 on the day I met Dr. Aneesh Narang at the emergency department of Banner‚ÄìUniversity Medical Center. He had already lost four or five patients to heatstroke over the summer and just treated one who was brought in with a body temperature of 106 degrees, struggling to breathe and unable to sweat. ‚ÄúPatients coming in at 108, 109 degrees‚Äîthey‚Äôve been in the heat for hours, they‚Äôre pretty much dead,‚Äù Narang said. ‚ÄúWe try to cool them down as fast as we can.‚Äù The method is to strip off their clothes and immerse them in ice and tap water inside a disposable cadaver bag to get their temperature down to 100 degrees within 15 or 20 minutes. But even those who survive heatstroke risk organ failure and years of neurological problems.

A¬†[scientific study published in May 2023](https://archive.is/o/VSGHP/https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c09588%23)¬†projected that a blackout during a five-day heat wave would kill nearly 1% of Phoenix‚Äôs population‚Äîabout 13,000 people‚Äîand send 800,000 to emergency rooms.

1dg6vlx,Worried About Climate Change? Join The Fight. ,"Hi, 

I work for one of the world's largest carbon removal companies, and I also live in the northeastern USA. We're about to experience record heatwaves. The current and potential impact of climate change terrifies me, especially later at night when my kids are sleeping and my brain won't stop thinking about their futures, and that of so many other people, animals, ecosystems, etc.

I joined this forum to read about others who might feel anxious. And as I read, I realized that one of the main reasons my climate anxiety isn't absolutely through the roof 100% of the time is because I'm working  on the solution to the problem. Myself and many, many others. 

If you're able to contribute, I urge you to do so. Pick up a shovel, as they say. Whatever you do for work, I bet it would translate beautifully in the work to reverse the damage that fossil fuels have done. 

Decarbonization coupled with carbon removal is going to mitigate the disastrous effects of climate change. Both of these movements / industries need every single human possible helping them along. This is a massive system change that requires everyone‚Äî¬†and no I do not mean investors and buyers‚Äî¬†I mean welders, truck drivers, teachers, mechanics, construction folks, electricians, laborers. The people of the world who move mass or the masses. 

Because ultimately, this is a problem of balance: The carbon cycles are out of balance, we have pumped too much slow carbon into the atmosphere and biosphere. We have to put a plug in that (decarbonize) and we have to bail the ship out (carbon removal.) This is a mass movement exercise. 

Folks, we've done it before‚Äî we pumped all of this out of the ground. We can do it again, but in reverse.

I'm saying this because I want to inspire hope. I want to inspire you to look at how you can contribute to both decarbonization of our systems as well as carbon removal, and then inspire you to **do** the thing. 

I've seen the data, I've seen the math, I've seen the term sheets, I've seen the sheer size of the problem, and I'm here to say that while it is seriously daunting**, it is not an impossible task**. It's just going to take mass mobilization and public support from every part of the world. 

My call to action? Start taking action by contributing to either the decarbonization industry or the carbon removal industry. Right now. Whoever you are. Change your career, raise awareness, hit me up if you want ideas. We need all of the help we can get.

**Note**: I understand that some people are skeptical of carbon removal, and that's okay. I'm at peace with that. I won't argue with you in the comments about it. ",326,165,2024-06-14 21:39:04,en

>Climate changes, but not always for the same reason. Today's rapid climate change is due entirely to man. The Holocene‚Äîthe last 12,000 years‚Äîhas been seen as having a stable climate, with a lack of chaos that allowed humans to settle down, develop agriculture, build civilizations and thrive.

1dgkdjo,"im trying to learn about carbon capture in grassland, this is my understanding so far, what have i got wrong?","since the extinction of the mammoths (due to humans) forests have taken over the grasslands, in most of northern Europe, eastern Europe and northern Asia.  
this is really bad as forests have a limited capacity to store carbon, as once a tree dies, all the carbon that it stored gets released back into the atmosphere.  
whereas grasslands do not do this.  
when large grazing animals move in herds on grassland, they trample all of the carbon rich grasses into the dirt.  
and most of the grass they eat is not digested, and is defecated with a lot of carbon still in there.  
when this happens the movement of these animals 'tells' the grass seeds to grow (they wait in the ground until these animals come along)  
these seeds then shoot up and grab onto all of this trampled grass, stopping it from rotting on the ground and releasing all the carbon, instead it breaks down in the dirt, making more carbon rich soil.  
  
so grasslands can (as long as the herd animals exist) store an infinite amount of carbon in the same amount of space where only one tree can exist.  
  
but all of these ancient grasslands disappeared when the mammoths went extinct, as they are the only animal in Europe and most of Asia that are big enough to push over trees and stop the forests growing

this is my understanding of the topic so far, but i know that some of it will be wrong, i just don't know which bits.",3,16,2024-06-15 11:23:39,en

The tree in our yard gradually lost its vitality through the 2010s before finally being cut down in 2020. We do get the occasional heat wave in the spring and summer, but the weather is still comfortable most other days of the two seasons, and we still get plenty of rain. Oddly, it seems the evergreen trees are fairing better than the broadleaves (especially when it comes to young trees). You think if it were related to heat, the evergreens would be doing worse, since they tend to favour cooler climates. Either way, reforestation is looking to be a lost cause; I'd say at least a third of the new trees being planted here don't last longer than three years.

<<Anyone who thought the very real impacts of sea level rise are decades in the future needs to recalibrate their thinking, and quickly. Sea level rise is already happening, affecting almost all of Florida‚Äôs 1,350 miles of coastline. And experts say it‚Äôs going to get worse at an increasing pace.

That gloomy forecast is one of the major findings in a startling Washington Post analysis of sea level rise across the American South, which is experiencing one of the most rapid surges on the planet. Scientists aren‚Äôt sure why it‚Äôs happening, but sea levels from Texas to Florida are at least 6 inches higher than they were 15 years ago. That matches the sea level rise that occurred over the last 50 years.>>

I pointed out that though the buying cost of EVs is more, their running cost is lower since petrol/diesel are expensive than electricity. Then they again pointed out its also about the cost of battery. The battery cost constitutes a considerable portion of the cost of EV. And the battery has to be replaced every few years. They did not have any concrete numbers but this was their understanding and the reason behind them not opting for EVs.

It occurs to me that ~20% of the US population lives in apartments. And given how apartments are generally built - baseboard heaters, so-so insulation, cheap appliances such as top load dishwashers, electric water heaters, no a/c except for a portable unit the tenant provides, there's a lot to be gained in this segment.

Now, of course, there's little incentive for either LLs or tenants to move to energy efficient building design or appliances. On the building side, it would cost more money. They would eat the cost of install for energy savings that would ultimately be passed to the tenant anyway, so there's no gain. On the tenant side, there's generally a contractual restriction for building / appliance modifications. And even if that wasn't restricted, it would make little sense to invest in a building the tenant doesn't own. The same goes for EVs and the lack of on-site charging. There seems to be a general incentive to 'stay with the old' and I'm incredibly curious what effects this has. 

Now... I've seen the odd article discussing this. But I've not been able to locate any numbers or data discussing what these impacts are. Does the multiple-people-one-building approach still offset less efficient appliances? How much is there to be gained? etc",5,7,2024-06-11 11:32:16,en

Did courses related to climate modelling, remote sensing, climate science, monsoon systems, oceanography in the minor area. Did courses related to data structures, algorithms, machine learning, AI, information retrieval and web search, OS, and many other typical CS degree courses. It was challenging and I liked most of the things, but really want to work in Climate change sector. I also want to keep learning hence would read about economics, policy, technology based solutions, nature based solutions. 

Need advice on what kind of contributions can I do in this sector - do we need better climate models for say global south? Do we need to work more on behavioral and social aspects (consumption and population). Do we need better renewable energy production systems and power grid according to that? I am confused where do I put my effort which would really be meaningful. I also did project with my professor in I would say Adaptation to climate change part - where we used lot of remote sensing data for natural resource management in Indian villages - farm ponds, LULC transitions over the years, topography of a certain area etc etc for ground water recharge and better farming income, finding forest fires and other such stuff.

However now I wish to know about jobs related to this sector, something which is really meaningful and worth the effort and something that I would enjoy doing as well. I think I would like climate modelling or science related part, should I do PhD in climate science? Would it be meaningful? or maybe a company where I get to use and learn new technologies? Or should I be climate educator? Or maybe solve some problem faced by climate journalists? More suggestions needed, more resources needed.

Cambridge researchers may have a new adage thanks to an ingenious method that can apparently make cleaner cement as part of the steelmaking process.¬†

As a result, it seems that two dirty materials can make a clean one.¬†

While the would-be proverb isn't quite on par with offerings from¬†[Confucious](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Confucius), the science behind the breakthrough could revolutionize manufacturing in the building sector. It's widely reported that the cement and steelmaking industries make up about¬†[8%](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24062022/concrete-is-worse-for-the-climate-than-flying-why-arent-more-people-talking-about-it/)¬†and¬†[7%](https://news.asu.edu/20231005-curtailing-unhealthy-impacts-steel-production)¬†of annual global air pollution.¬†

The Cambridge Electric Cement process begins with concrete waste from demolition of old buildings. This is crushed, to separate the stones and sand that form concrete from the mixture of cement powder and water that bind them together. The old cement powder is then used instead of lime-flux in steel recycling. As the steel melts, the flux forms a slag that floats on the liquid steel, to protect it from oxygen in the air. After the recycled steel is tapped off, the liquid slag is cooled rapidly in air, and ground up into a powder which is virtually identical to the clinker which is the basis of new Portland cement. In pilot-scale trials of the new process, the Cambridge team have demonstrated this combined recycling process, and the results show that it has the chemical composition of a clinker made with today‚Äôs process.",46,2,2024-06-24 15:30:26,en

A sleeping duck curve means no excessive solar supply in the middle of the day (thus no curtailment) and power available for the evening, eliminating peak hour. ‚ÄúAcross all the modelled scenarios, rooftop solar plus battery trading reduces the 4‚Äì8pm wholesale market evening peak by 67‚Äì92%.‚Äù This will have significant impacts on the revenues of traditional generators.

""Amidst the ongoing conflict and political tension, Russia has managed to achieve a remarkable feat with its **first internationally recognized climate reduction project**, demonstrating the irony of a country making strides in environmentalism while simultaneously engaging in a large-scale military conflict.""

""SIBUR, Russia‚Äôs largest petrochemical facility at ZapSibNeftekhim, is the subject of the project which has been certified by Europe's leading validation and verification body, Verico SCE. The project is focused on recycling the by-products of the facility for heat and power generation as well as feeding feedstock residues that cannot be brought back into the core production cycle. This effort will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and has earned SIBUR, Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) totaling **approximately 3 million tones a year**.""

""The Russian move to establish a carbon credit methodology and establish climate reduction projects can be attributed to growing international policies regulating greenhouse gas emissions.""

Have you heard about Future Spirit Festival? It's a new music & arts festival near Boston that is running a fundraiser to power as much of their sound/lights/infrastructure off clean energy as possible. Donations go straight into purchasing solar/clean electric generators to run the event.

If the goal is met they are matching 10% of the donations towards a environmental-sustainability-related charity. 

I'm an avid festival goer and this project makes me so happy because I would love to see these life-changing events do a lot better at reducing their carbon emissions and taking better care of attendees / the environment. 

The Kickstarter is at 15% and only has 2 weeks to hit their goal or all of the donations are cancelled. Does anyone here vibe with this message? If so please consider contributing and helping make a momentous movement forward for the Future of Festivals!

>AI Overview:

>If Earth were as far from the sun as Venus, it would receive less radiation and have a colder climate. Earth's distance from the sun allows water to remain liquid, which is important for life. If Earth were farther away from the sun, its oceans would freeze, which would cause them to release less carbon dioxide and vapor. This could lead to a scenario where Earth turns into a hothouse planet similar to Venus, which has a runaway greenhouse effect that causes its oceans to boil away.

Reflect Orbital aims to reflect the sun's rays over solar panels on the earth's surface well after it's gone dark. Stunning video footage shows how the tech could illuminate the night sky with the reflected light.

>... Many speakers talked about having solar panels up in space, but Nowack has a different idea. He wants to shoot 57 small satellites into orbit armed with 33-square-foot ultra reflective mylar mirrors that would theoretically bounce sunlight back down to solar farms.

1ex77wy,Roles of Earth‚Äôs Albedo Variations and Top-of-the-Atmosphere Energy Imbalance in Recent Warming: New Insights from Satellite and Surface Observations,"Analogous to the famous ‚Äúfollow-the-money‚Äù approach often adopted by the social and political sciences to explain human behavior and social movements, this study can be described as a ‚Äúfollow-the-energy‚Äù journey to investigate the causes of recent climate warming.

The IPCC AR6 Working Group I (WG1) concluded that well-mixed greenhouse gases were ‚Äúvery likely the main driver of tropospheric warming since 1979‚Äù [1]. However, Chapter 7 of the IPCC AR6 WG1 Contribution did not take into proper consideration the observed increase of solar radiation absorption by Earth in recent decades known as ‚Äúglobal brightening‚Äù [2] (Section 7.2.2.3). The Report did not analyze the decrease of Earth‚Äôs shortwave reflectance evident in the CERES EBAF dataset over the past 20 years and its impact on GSAT. Published studies agree that the observed decrease of planetary albedo and the associated increase of solar-energy uptake by the planet must have had a significant impact on the global temperature. However, there has been no attempts thus far to quantify the actual effect of this solar forcing on GSAT. We tried to bridge this knowledge gap by developing a novel, non-statistical process model from First Principles that explicitly relates changes in TSI and albedo to global temperature anomalies. The model (Equation (16)) was derived from independent NASA planetary observations and basic rules of calculus without using Earth-specific data, greenhouse-gas radiative forcing, or positive (amplifying) feedbacks. Our goal was to verify the above IPCC AR6 conclusion by assessing the direct effect of measured changes in TSI and Earth‚Äôs sunlight absorption on the 21st-century global surface warming as documented by 6 temperature datasets.

Our analysis revealed that the solar forcing (i.e., TSI and albedo changes) measured by CERES explain 100% of the observed global warming trend and 83% of the interannual GSAT variability over the past 24 years (Figure 9), including the extreme 2023 heat anomaly (Figure 10). Albedo changes were found to be by far the dominant GSAT driver, while TSI variations only played a minor, modulating role (Figure 11 and Figure 12). The sustained increase of sunlight absorption by the planet was also identified as the most likely driver of ocean warming in recent decades based on a high correlation (R2 = 0.8) between the shortwave radiation uptake and the mean annual temperature anomaly of the 0‚Äì100 m global oceanic layer (Figure 8). These results suggest a lack of physical reality to both the anthropogenic radiative forcing attributed to rising greenhouse gases and the positive (amplifying) feedbacks hypothesized by the greenhouse theory and simulated by climate models. This is because any real forcing (or amplifying feedback) outside of the increased planetary uptake of solar radiation would have produced additional warming above and beyond the amount explained by changes in the planetary albedo and TSI. However, no such extra warming is observed in the available temperature records. Hence, the anthropogenic radiative forcing and associated positive feedbacks are likely model artifacts rather than real phenomena. The empirical data and model calculations analyzed in our study also indicate that the Earth‚Äôs climate sensitivity to radiative forcing is only 0.29‚Äì0.30 K/(W m‚àí2). Therefore, the greenhouse theory overestimates this parameter by 56‚Äì158%.

The lack of evidence for heat trapping by greenhouse gases in the climate system during the 21st Century raises an important question about the physical nature of the Earth‚Äôs Energy Imbalance (EEI). The latter is defined as the difference between the absorbed shortwave and outgoing LW flux at the TOA. EEI has been observed and calculated by various monitoring platforms for several decades. This index became a research focus in climate science during the past 15 years, because it has been perceived as evidence of anthropogenic heat accumulation (energy retention) in the Earth system that would commit the World to a prolonged future warming, even after human carbon emissions have reached a net-zero level. As a result of such a view, EEI is now called the ‚Äúmost fundamental indicator for climate change‚Äù [33]. However, our analysis of observed data, model calculations, and standard thermodynamic theory showed that EEI has been misinterpreted by the science community, since it arises from adiabatic dissipation of thermal energy in ascending air parcels in the troposphere due to a decreasing atmospheric pressure with height (see discussion in Section 4). Hence, integrating EEI over space and time in an effort to calculate some total ‚Äúenergy gain‚Äù by the Earth system, as done by researchers in recent years, is physically misleading, because EEI includes energy that was adiabatically lost to the system during the convective cooling process. Our analyses also showed that this energy imbalance results from a varying sunlight absorption by the planet and would only disappear if the Earth‚Äôs albedo stops changing and the uptake of shortwave radiation stabilizes, which is unlikely to ever occur. The reduction of human greenhouse-gas emissions cannot and will not affect EEI. Nevertheless, the Earth has gained a considerable amount of thermal energy over the past 45 years due to a sustained increase of shortwave-radiation uptake, which is a completely different mechanism from the theorized trapping of radiant heat by greenhouse gases, since it does not involve a hidden energy storage.

These findings call for a fundamental reconsideration of the current paradigm of understanding about climate change and related socio-economic initiatives aimed at drastic reductions of industrial carbon emissions at all costs. An important aspect of this paradigm shift should be the prioritized allocation of funds to support large-scale interdisciplinary research into the physical mechanisms controlling the Earth‚Äôs albedo and cloud physics, for these are the real drivers of climate on multidecadal time scales.

The global warming spike at the end is unprecedented, especially so when they can read the temperature in 2100.

Now let's look at this [**graph**.](https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2021/new-method-shows-today.jpg) Nice how the temperatures have barely changed a tenth of a degree in the last 8,000 years until you get to that huge climate change uptick at the end.

Both seem to be proof of global warming until you see the trick in this [**graph**.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nasrat-Adamo/publication/327690004/figure/fig1/AS:671758415839242@1537171095688/Temperature-from-12-000BC-to-the-present-from-Greenland-ice-measurements-of-Oxygen.jpg)

This graph runs from 12,000 years ago to now, it's the Greenland ice-core temperature record and it hasn't been averaged over time. The first two graphs are heavily averaged until they only show a less than a one-tenth of a degree 'ripple. The 'disastrous' 1.5 C  blip wouldn't stand out at all if it was placed at the end of this graph. 

Now for the trick. Take a 20,000 year temperature graph and filter it until it only shows a tenth of a degree ripple over a century time-span.

Then graft unfiltered instrumental record of the past 100 or so years onto the end of the 20,000 year graph. Instant alarming climate change proof. Instant alarming climate change graph, almost zero temperature change for 8,000 years and then whammo, a huge 1.5 degrees explosion climbing like a homesick angel into uncharted territory!

Doubt that the alarmists use this trick? Look at the first graph and see the little notch at the 10,000 year mark. Now compare it to last graph at 10,000 years. What you're seeing is the Younger Dryas event, 3,000 years of ice age temperatures that have been filtered away into a half a degree temperature blip.",84,43,2024-08-17 18:46:54,en
1ev0ijp,CO2 is the GREENING molecule: New study shows how elevated CO2 levels increase vegetation growth and WATER AVAILABILITY in the Northern Hemisphere,"The Democrat‚Äôs Green New Deal proposes a war on carbon dioxide, investing in methods to sequester this all-important atmospheric gas under the ground. However, according to new research, elevated CO2 levels are not only important for vegetation growth, but also play a role in maintaining water availability in the Northern Hemisphere. Artificial carbon capture and other geoengineering projects could be the main driving force behind wildfires, droughts and collapsing water tables in the Northern Hemisphere.

The study, published in Environmental Research Letters, reveals significant changes in the relationship between vegetation growth and water availability in the Northern Hemisphere's mid-latitudes over the past three decades. The research, led by Yang Song and colleagues, highlights the impact of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels on this relationship, suggesting a closer relationship between vegetation growth and water availability than previously understood.

The very compound that the Democrats are targeting ‚Äì CO2 ‚Äì is actually the solution to preserving croplands, grasslands, forests and water supplies for growing populations.

>RICHLAND, Wash.‚ÄîLast year marked Earth‚Äôs warmest year on record. A new study finds that some of 2023‚Äôs record warmth, nearly 20 percent, likely came as a result of reduced sulfur emissions from the shipping industry. Much of this warming concentrated over the northern hemisphere.

The authors used a [machine learning](https://www.pnnl.gov/artificial-intelligence) approach to scan over a million satellite images and quantify the declining count of ship tracks, estimating a 25 to 50 percent reduction in visible tracks.

1elxfam,Amazon soil may store billions more tonnes of carbon than once thought,"Nutrient-rich ""dark earth"" soil may store an amount of carbon nearly equivalent to annual CO2 emissions in the US, a finding that suggests the Amazon sequesters far more carbon than previously known. 

Rich soil in the Amazon cultivated over centuries by Indigenous communities may store billions of tonnes of carbon, suggesting that the rainforest plays an even larger role in stabilising the global climate than previously thought.

The soil, known as ‚Äúterra preta‚Äù or ‚Äúdark earth‚Äù for its distinctive colour, is formed by people spreading ash and other organic waste around settlements. It is more fertile than the region‚Äôs typically sandy, nutrient-poor soils, and stores around double the carbon. In some areas, dark earth may contain as much carbon as the plants growing above it.

Archaeologists have identified dark earth deposits at sites across the Amazon basin, but the total amount of such soil currently present in the region remains unknown.

Samuel Goldberg at the University of Miami in Florida and his colleagues used satellite imagery to predict the areas with dark earth across the 2.6 million-hectare Xingu Indigenous Territory in the south-east Amazon. In this region, dark earth cultivation, including by modern Kuikuro farmers, has been well documented.
Because the soil is hidden from satellites by tree cover, the researchers looked at differences in the colour of the tree canopy. They found that undisturbed trees growing on dark earth have higher amounts of chlorophyll in their leaves and can reflect more infrared light.

The researchers trained a machine learning algorithm on satellite imagery data on forest colour from sites known to contain dark earth. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt see it, but the satellite can,‚Äù says Goldberg. This let them predict spots with dark earth throughout the entire region.
The algorithm predicted that at least 3.4 per cent of the region, or 91,000 hectares, contained dark earth, the majority of which was unknown sites. The algorithm also had low error rates when predicting known dark earth sites. The researchers estimate this human-modified soil stores 9 million tonnes more carbon than it would otherwise.

The results from Xingu can‚Äôt reliably be extrapolated to the whole Amazon basin without more regional data. But if dark earth is present to the same extent across the more than 5.5-million-square-kilometre basin, dark earth in the Amazon could store billions of tonnes of carbon ‚Äì an amount approaching the annual CO2 emissions of the US, says Goldberg.

‚Äú[Our survey] is huge relative to what you can do with a shovel at an archaeological site, but tiny relative to the entire Amazon,‚Äù he says. [Widespread Amazonian dark earth in the Xingu Indigenous Territory](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-024-01399-3)",19,5,2024-08-06 20:03:54,en

""With the formation of only 3 tropical storms in the basin so far, 
activity in the eastern Pacific is at an historic low.  Typically by 
the end of July, the season produces 5 or 6 tropical storms, 3 
hurricanes, and 1 or 2 major hurricanes.  The Accumulated Cyclone 
Energy (ACE), which measures the combined strength and duration of 
tropical storms and hurricanes, is only 5 percent of the long-term 
(1991-2020) average, making this the slowest start to an eastern 
Pacific season during the reliable period of records in the basin 
(1971-2024).""

Good weather doesn't get reported because it is boring. Everyone has been focusing on the Atlantic where Hurricane Beryl became the earliest Category 5 Hurricane in the Atlantic Basin on record. 

Mother Nature has a unique way of balancing out. Usually when one basin has hyper active tropical activity, there's another that is quiet. This year may be a prime example. ",20,5,2024-08-06 11:20:27,en

Not to sound crass, but the minor increase in deaths in some places appears far less than deaths from COVID-19 & simply being poor...which more would be with unreliable, non-transportable energy that depends excessively on electricity.

As Dr. Curry points out, anything we do to limit CO2 this century makes virtually no difference before 2100+, especially if natural warming is being caused by the sun & other factors.

This is from a July 2024 study I've never seen before. Basically, it shows that in many areas, deaths would decline regionally due to climate change...perhaps more than they increase elsewhere.

>....The dry air prevents the buildup of tall clouds that are needed to form a hurricane. As well, the SAL creates a temperature inversion, which means a layer of warm air remains over colder air, causing clouds to spread out rather than rise to form thunderstorms. And the strong winds that carry the layer along causes wind shear, which can tear storms apart....

>...""Whenever there's a period of quiet activity in the atmosphere, whether it's tropical storms or winter storms, usually that means there's energy building up somewhere in the ocean atmosphere system,"" he said, adding that with no strong winds stirring up the Atlantic, its surface temperatures will continue to rise -- a key source of energy for hurricanes.

In summary, storms are bad. The lack of storms are also bad. More storms are made by man. Lack of storms not made by man.

>Researchers at Tsinghua University in China performed two safety tests on the Shidaowan plant‚Äôs reactor modules by shutting off active power supply to see if the decay heat could be removed passively.

how pebble-bed works

>Shidaowan‚Äôs twin 100-MW units house tiny uranium capsules encased in graphite shells about the size of billiard balls (dubbed ‚Äúpebbles‚Äù), which make the energy density of the fuel much lower than in a traditional nuclear reactor with fuel rods. In the pebble design, the nuclear fission reaction occurs more slowly than in conventional reactors, but the fuel can withstand higher temperatures for longer and the heat resulting from the fission reaction is dispersed, enabling a passive cooling process.

>The reactor doesn‚Äôt rely on large volumes of water in the cooling process‚Äîinstead, a small amount of helium gas, which can withstand much higher temperatures than water, is piped through the system to naturally cool it down. If the reactor starts to get too hot, its components automatically slow down the nuclear reaction and the system cools. This setup makes such a reactor ‚Äúmeltdown proof,‚Äù in concept.",14,2,2024-07-26 10:57:09,en

https://www.amazon.com/San-Fransicko-Progressives-Ruin-Cities/dp/0063093626

San Fransicko refers to San Francisco and its homeless. We learn how the Far Left throws the homeless under the bus for their own interests. In this sense, San Fransicko points at what is wrong with the Far Left. These people are sick in the head (Shellenberger: ‚Äú... the so-called Dark Triad personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy."") Unfortunately, they are well organized, well funded (government money, Soros and other philanthropists) and they know exactly how to manipulate decent (perhaps not too smart, but still decent ;) ) people on the left.

My conclusion is that the Left is too weak to stand up to the Far Left, which is why the Far Left currently makes most of the decisions in the US, but also in many other countries, even though they are a minority.

1e8tyj1,"Mother Nature can solve climate change, without human help/intervention","I was just wondering something, as a weather hobbyist for 33+ years.......if the air and oceans are indeed warming, as climate change activists say, that means with warmer ocean/sea water temperature means more evaporation, and hence, more water vapor. With an increase in global air temperature, that means that air can hold more moisture, as its capacity increases, as the temperature of the air goes up, because, as we learned in chemistry class, a solution can hold more solutes (in this case, earth's atmosphere is the solvent, with water vapor as the liquid solute), when you raise its overall temperature.

With more evaporation and increase in the capacity for air to hold more moisture, due to rising sea water and air temperatures, that would mean more clouds and rain.

More clouds and rain, would mean that the earth's surface would get less sunlight, as it would be blocked by the clouds and rain (more sunlight would be reflected by the clouds, back into outer space), which would then lead to temperatures to cool down, thereby, restoring a natural balance or equilibrium, in terms of the global air and sea water temperatures. This is similar to the process of homeostasis.

This would be a natural feedback loop, by which Nature will, on her own, without human help or intervention will fight the rising global temperatures - both the air and even the sea/ocean temperatures. It will take decades or even centuries to do, but Nature will succeed. 

There is no climate crisis, because eventually, Nature will eventually restore balance and equilibrium, through natural physical processes. We need to trust in nature.....go with the flow.",26,9,2024-07-21 15:10:20,en

Fake scientific papers are alarmingly common

‚ÄúWhen neuropsychologist Bernhard Sabel put his new fake-paper detector to work, he was ‚Äúshocked‚Äù by what it found. After screening some 5000 papers, he estimates up to 34% of neuroscience papers published in 2020 were likely made up or plagiarized; in medicine, the figure was 24%. Both numbers, which he and colleagues report in a medRxiv preprint posted on 8 May, are well above levels they calculated for 2010‚Äîand far larger than the 2% baseline estimated in a 2022 publishers‚Äô group report.‚Äù

Among 222 novel therapeutics approved by the FDA from 2001 through 2010, 32% were affected by a postmarket safety event. Biologics, psychiatric therapeutics, and accelerated and near‚Äìregulatory deadline approval were statistically significantly associated with higher rates of events. The high frequency of postmarket safety events highlights the need for continuous monitoring of the safety of novel therapeutics throughout their life cycle.‚Äù

Hidden conflicts? Pharma payments to FDA advisers after drug approvals spark ethical concerns
Science investigation of journal disclosures and pharmaceutical funding records shows potential influence on physician gatekeepers

‚ÄúAmong the investigation's key findings:
* Of 107 physician advisers who voted on the committees Science examined, 40 over a nearly 4-year period received more than $10,000 in post hoc earnings or research support from the makers of drugs that the panels voted to approve, or from competing firms; 26 of those gained more than $100,000; and six more than $1 million.
* Of the more than $24 million in personal payments or research support from industry to the 16 top-earning advisers‚Äîwho received more than $300,000 each‚Äî93% came from the makers of drugs those advisers previously reviewed or from competitors.
* Most of those top earners‚Äîand many others‚Äîreceived other funds from those same companies, concurrent with or in the year before their advisory service. Those payments were disclosed in scholarly journals but not by FDA.‚Äù       


‚ÄúElliott suggests a more radical solution. ""Even in the best of circumstances, disclosure is a remarkably weak way of controlling conflicts of interest,"" he says. ""A better way would simply be for the FDA to say, ‚ÄòWe are not taking anybody with any kind of conflict on an advisory committee.'""

The largest scientific experiment in history was Peer Review and it failed

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt reviewers catch basic errors and blatant fraud? One reason is that they almost never look at the data behind the papers they review, which is exactly where the errors and fraud are most likely to be. In fact,¬†most¬†journals don‚Äôt require you to make your data public at all. You‚Äôre supposed to provide them ‚Äúon request,‚Äù but¬†most people don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs how we‚Äôve ended up in sitcom-esque situations like¬†~20%¬†of genetics papers having totally useless data because Excel autocorrected the names of genes into months and years.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut science is a strong-link problem: progress depends on the quality of our¬†best¬†work.¬†Better ideas don‚Äôt always triumph immediately, but they do triumph eventually, because they‚Äôre more useful. You can‚Äôt land on the moon using¬†Aristotle‚Äôs physics, you can‚Äôt turn mud into frogs using¬†spontaneous generation, and you can‚Äôt build bombs out of¬†phlogiston. Newton‚Äôs laws of physics stuck around; his¬†recipe for the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone¬†didn‚Äôt. We didn‚Äôt need a scientific establishment to smother the wrong ideas. We needed it to let new ideas challenge old ones, and time did the rest.
Weak-link thinking makes scientific censorship seem reasonable, but all censorship does is make old ideas harder to defeat.‚Äù

- Do frequently recharge, ideally when you get to 40% charging only to 60%, meaning just 20% range or 50 miles on a 250 mile range EV
- If going on long trip, only charge to 75%, but even then preferably recharge when you get to 30%
- At beginning, he says your car may lose 10% of available charge the very first recharge! No wonder no EV ever matches their range rating!

In 2023, Gulf of Mexico water temperatures where in the high 90's and some measurements approaching 100F.  This was near Key West where the air temperature is much cooler (often around 92-93F).

I pointed out that the other major source of heat besides the sun is geothermal heat.  It is already known that there is geothermal heating of the Gulf so having a water temperature much higher than the air temperature would imply to me that there is an additional source of heat that the water sees that the air is not exposed to, geothermal heating.

[Nature Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01715-9)

A common type of ocean algae plays a significant role in producing a massively abundant compound that helps cool the Earth‚Äôs climate, new research has discovered. 
 
The findings of the study by the University of East Anglia (UEA) and Ocean University of China (OUC) could change our understanding of how these tiny marine organisms impact our planet. 
 
The team identified the bloom-forming Pelagophyceae algae as potentially abundant and important producers of a compound called dimethylsulfoniopropionate, or DMSP.  
 
Co-lead author Professor Jonathan Todd, of UEA‚Äôs School of Biological Sciences, said: ‚ÄúThe Pelagophyceae are amongst the most abundant algae on Earth, yet they were not previously known as important producers of DMSP.  
 
‚ÄúThis discovery is exciting because DMSP is an abundant antistress compound, food source for other microorganisms and major source of climate-cooling gases.‚Äù  
 
Dr Jinyan Wang, OUC/UEA PhD student and first author, said: ‚ÄúUnderstanding the role of Pelagophyceae in DMSP production means we need to rethink how much of this compound is being produced and how it impacts our climate."" 
 
Every year, billions of tonnes of DMSP are produced in the Earth's oceans by marine microorganisms, helping them to survive by protecting against various stresses like changes in salinity, cold, high pressure, and oxidative stress.  
 
Importantly, DMSP is the main source of a climate active gas called dimethylsulfide (DMS), which is known as the smell of the seaside.  
 
This study suggests that DMSP production, and consequently DMS release, is likely higher than previously predicted and emphasises the key role of microbes in regulating global climate.

Mapped monthly data products of surface ocean acidification indicators from 1998 to 2022 on a 0.25¬∞ by 0.25¬∞ spatial grid have been developed for eleven U.S. large marine ecosystems (LMEs). The data products were constructed using observations from the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas, co-located surface ocean properties, and two types of machine learning algorithms: Gaussian mixture models to organize LMEs into clusters of similar environmental variability and random forest regressions (RFRs) that were trained and applied within each cluster to spatiotemporally interpolate the observational data. The data products, called RFR-LMEs, have been averaged into regional timeseries to summarize the status of ocean acidification in U.S. coastal waters, showing a domain-wide carbon dioxide partial pressure increase of 1.4‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.4 Œºatm yr‚àí1 and pH decrease of 0.0014‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.0004‚Äâyr‚àí1. RFR-LMEs have been evaluated via comparisons to discrete shipboard data, fixed timeseries, and other mapped surface ocean carbon chemistry data products. Regionally averaged timeseries of RFR-LME indicators are provided online through the NOAA National Marine Ecosystem Status web portal.",9,11,2024-07-04 02:19:33,en

Although finance remains the most popular career option for Columbia climate majors, Schaefer notes that there are two other fast-growing fields: climate justice and climate communications. The first focuses on how climate change disproportionately impacts marginalized populations and looks to create climate solutions that don‚Äôt exacerbate current inequities. The communications focus looks to bridge the gap between climate scientists who are pressing for change and the politicians, industry leaders, and wider public who have the power to make it happen.

What is the non-planet saving response by these two, slap 100% tarrifs on sensible cars that could actually save the planet. Environmental 'Judo' ü•ã

>The car, launched last year by Chinese automaker BYD, sells for around $12,000 in China, but drives well and is put together with craftsmanship that rivals U.S.-made electric vehicles that cost three times as much. A shorter-range version costs under $10,000.

>Outside of China, EVs are often pricey, aimed at a higher-income niche market.

1dl6zsn,SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION ON CLIMATE CHANGE DEFINITION AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE PUBLIC'S (POLITICAL) VIEW. QUESTIONS TO THINK ABOUT IT.,"We should write a book about this argument because there is a lot of misinterpretation that affect the public view on the CLIMATE CHANGE phenomenon.

Let‚Äôs start reading the following scientific definition of CLIMATE CHANGE:

BRITANNICA ENCYCLOPEDIA:

*Climate change, periodic modification of Earth‚Äôs climate brought about as a result of changes in the atmosphere as well as interactions between the atmosphere and various other geologic, chemical, biological, and geographic factors within the Earth system.*

*(*[*https://www.britannica.com/science/climate-change*](https://www.britannica.com/science/climate-change)*)*

¬†

Now let‚Äôs compare it with the following definitions:

¬†

UNITED NATIONS:

*Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun‚Äôs activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s,*¬†[*primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.*](https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/) *human activities have been the main driver of climate change.*

*(*[*https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change*](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change)*)*

¬†

***QUESTION 1:***

***SINCE WE ARE A PRODUCT OF THE NATURE AND WE ARE PART OF IT, DO HUMANS ARE STILL THINKING WE ARE DIFFERENTS AND UNIQUE (ANTHROPOCENTRIC VIEW)?***

***QUESTION 2:***

***SINCE WE ARE AWARE OF OUR CONTRIBUTION ON THE ACTUAL CLIMATIC CHANGE, SHOULD HUMAN THINKS RATIONALLY TO MITIGATE IT OR SHOULD WE ACCEPT IT AS A NATURAL PROCESS?***

***QUESTION 3:***

***SINCE CAPITALISM IS DRIVEN BY PROFIT, AND MONEY ARE AT THE BASE OF EVERYTHING IN LIFE, SHOULD WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM TO MITIGATE AND EVENTUALLY REDUCE THE ACTUAL CLIMATE CHANGE?***

¬†

***My personal opinion is that it is impossible to stop the actual climate change. Probably we can try to mitigate it but there are many others factors that came into the big picture that are out of our control. It is like to try to save the coast line from erosion, or to stop a landslide, or a volcanic eruption. Maybe it will work for some years but at the end force of gravity, tides, waves, sea level, plate tectonic will win.***",8,2,2024-06-21 11:39:51,en

1djiij2,A little story from my piece of the world and how an outsider wouldn‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶(climate change insanity related),"So I live in Indiana. we have had a pretty wet spring so far. Only in recent weeks has it dried out. it was good because last fall was exceptionally dry due to the strong El Ni√±o. 

We also have a small summer home in Northeast Indiana. For as long as I can remember going back to childhood, there have been irrigation systems in the corn and soybean fields. Why is that? Because the soil in that area contains less clay and is more porous than soil and the central and southern regions of Indiana. Regular rains are not enough to help the crops grow. It has been like this since the 80s when we started going up there. 

Why is that important? Because I‚Äôm going to give you an example of someone not familiar with the area could cry ‚Äúclimate change‚Äú! Without knowing the facts‚Ä¶.. our very modest home has a small yard which can be easily push mowed. Two weekends ago (after not being up there due to my son‚Äôs baseball schedule for about a month) that yard was long and green. It definitely needed to be mowed. That Saturday night we got a downpour but it did not rain the entire week afterwards, and when we return the following Friday the yard was brown. now knowing the area as I do‚Ä¶ I did not panic. Because: this is the time of year when the sun is at its peak and strongest in terms of solar output for Indiana. We are approaching solstice, things dry out rather quickly. Most people up that way water their yards if they want them to stay green when we hit this time of year. I really don‚Äôt care because we don‚Äôt play around in the yard a ton and spend most of our time on the lake‚Ä¶ by the way has not dried up, lol. It is spring fed and even in drought conditions still contains more than enough water to go boating. 

My over arching point is this: someone with no knowledge of that area would immediately conclude that a drought is going on and that climate change is to blame‚Ä¶..never mind the fact that just a week prior the grass was super tall and lush green. But because of the heat and power of the sun combined with soil that does not hold water very well, things dry out fast. 

That‚Äôs just my little snapshot as to why it is important to know your surroundings and historical trends beyond just weather. It took me well into adulthood to understand the soil and its factor as to why the grass ‚Äú browns out‚Äù so quickly vs. the yard in my central Indiana home (which is still very green and growing well despite a period of dryness)

I encourage others to share similar stories‚Ä¶.",16,5,2024-06-19 08:56:30,en

These matches enable precise and unambiguous tracking of inner core progression and regression. The resolved different rates of forward and backward motion suggest that new models will be necessary for the dynamics between the inner core, outer core and mantle.

Our method and observations provide the most definitive evidence so far that the IC is moving relative to the rest of the Earth, and specifically that it is slowly and smoothly rotating on a reversing path. The observation that the westward sub-rotation is less than half as fast as the last part of the eastward super-rotation is well-resolved and begs models with that character. 

Identification of repeating pairs in which waveform changes and ddt from rotation cancel will allow greater resolution in the question of whether other processes near the IC boundary are also appearing. Examination with these methods of repeating IC waves on other paths, further in the past and into the future, promises rapid progress in monitoring motion in a difficult and enigmatic region.",25,5,2024-06-15 23:50:16,en

There is a need to explore the physical connections between heliospheric compression and planetary climates and atmospheres. The consequences of the Earth being exposed to the ISM are outside the present work. Here we just comment briefly on some of them. First, there is a possible consequence for Earth's climate. 

Large amounts of neutral hydrogen as a result of an encounter with cold clouds with densities above 1,000 cm-3 will alter the chemistry of Earth's atmosphere. This needs careful examination including the physics of cloud formation. Very few works have investigated the climatic effects of such encounters quantitatively in the context of encounters with dense giant molecular clouds. 

Some argue that such high densities would deplete the ozone in the mid-atmosphere (50-100 km) and eventually cool the Earth43,44. This work should be revisited with modern atmospheric modelling. This cooling is aligned with what is seen for oxygen isotopes measured in the microscopic skeletons of foraminifera on the sea floor*5. 

It has been suggested that climate changes around this time could have affected human evolution 46,47,48,49. The hypothesis is that the emergence of our species Homo sapiens was shaped by the need to adapt to climate changeS. With the shrinkage of the heliosphere, the Earth was exposed directly to the ISM.

Another effect would be increased radiation from an increased flux of GCRs. Voyagers 1 and 2 showed that the heliosphere shields the GCRs for intensities 70 MeV-5 GeV by 80% (refs. 151). During the passage through a cold cloud, Earth is exposed to the bare GCR intensity, which is enhanced further by the compression of the cold cloud if the GCRs are trapped within the cloud, although some studies 2 argue that the GCR spectra in dense clouds are like the local ISM. 

Detailed modelling of GCR diffusion is needed to explore the impact of GCRs on climate and habitability. Additionally, the passage through such a dense cloud would have an additional effect on Earth's atmosphere through interstellar dust accumulation 3. This also should be investigated.",16,1,2024-06-15 22:57:55,en
1dgkmja,"Diversity and inclusion for you, but not for us","The more we understand about how spectacularly wrong and dumb the CO2's Enhanced Greenhouse Effect theory is, the more I wonder how we got here in the first place.

Granted, it took me a couple of years to figure it out, but I have a job to do and a family to feed. But there were people who are paid to study ""climate science"", and I find it hard to believe 97% of them fell for the idea and did not do their due dilligence. Because it is not difficult at all to figure out and these people, who all went to (good) universities, can not all be this dumb.

One of the posters here says it is difficult to be critical if your paycheck depends on not being critical, and I get that, but there must have been at least one ""climate scientist"" or one ""journalist"" who thought, hold on a second, something is not right here..

Our brain works in a rather idiotic way. This has to do with how our brain evolved: is the animal walking over there food, or am I going to be food? To survive, the few milliseconds which were gained by making the correct decision led to an evolution into the current design. And in this design, the brain constantly makes assumptions based on past experiences, with our sensors (eyes, ears, etc) having to convince the brain it is wrong, and this leads to confirmation bias: we see what we want to see and we hear what we want to hear. If you want to go a bit deeper, check [YouTube for the McGurk effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFPtc8BVdJk). I guarantee you will be shocked.

Cool story bro, but what does this have to do with climate change?

[When Sabine Hossenfelder discussed the Greenhouse Effect on YouTube, she struggled with the material. How did the Greenhouse Effect work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqu5DjzOBF8) But she had already made the assumption it was working, and her brain was doing its best to put the puzzle together. Confirmation bias.

This brings me to the title of my piece: we got here, because the media and the (social) sciences are dominated by the Left, and their confirmation bias has replaced common sense with dogma. This could have been avoided if a few of us would have been present, but these bastions of the Left do not tolerate us very well. Which is ironic, given their fascination with DEI. DEI for us, but not for them.

A similar effect can be seen when the media and left wing politicians are going bonkers about another ""unexpected"" election result. The fact is that the majority of the people are not siding with them, but with us. And I'm fed up with these assholes telling us in their shitty newspapers and their horrible ""news"" shows how to live and what to do, while they refuse to play by their own rules.

You want diversity? What about this: if your rag, news station, or university does not have a reasonable representation of the political landscape, you WILL be affected by confirmation bias and you WILL NOT be able to fulfill your mission statement. Since most of these assholes are funded with tax payers' money, it is crucial to demand a fair representation.

1dehlg8,Michael Mann funny again,"You don't even need to have a critical attitude to embarrass a ""climate scientist"" like Michael Mann over the biased BS he talks. This one is an amazingly funny example.

Mann promoted the talking point of how accurate models are and so he matched the average model output against the actual temperature record, fitting like a glove. What con-artists do in these cases is fondling with (already manipulated) temperature records to better fit them with the model output. Unless you make a screenshot and look at it pixel by pixel, you could not tell. His chart therefore shows a warming of at least 1.2¬∞C since the 1970s.

Regrettably for Mann the talk settles on the 1.5¬∞C threshold with Mann explaining it would be broken by the early 2030s. What he forgot is that said treshold is not relative to the 1970s, but to ""pre-industrial"". At that point it became way too obvious that his chart had far too much warming. If the Earth had warming 1.2¬∞C since the 1970s, then of course we had went beyond the 1.5¬∞C threshold already.

It is also easy to see looking at it another way. Since the mid 1970s five decades have past. If there were 1.2¬∞C warming since then, that would equate to a 0.24¬∞C/decade warming trend. The actual warming trend is only 0.14-0.15 with satellite data, and 0.18-0.19 with other data sets (GISS, hadcrut..). So we are officially at 0.7 to 0.95¬∞C of warming since then alltogether, not 1.2¬∞C.

Just watch Mann trying to talk himself out of the hole he just digged. And honor the comment by Mr. Dan Miller (""Ok, I'm confused now.."") LOL

1deez58,"Is 3.0 Really Greater Than 0.85? - ‚ÄúWell, you might think so but you would be applying the na√Øve mathematics of the climate change denier.""","by John Ridgway

According to the BBC, we now live in a world of misinformation and fake news, in which fake experts and denialists peddle anti-science conspiracies that endanger us all. This has led to the establishment of fact-checking, in which the so-called denialist claims are seemingly debunked by self-appointed arbiters of the truth. To illustrate how these fact-checks often work in practice, I offer you the following fictional account of how the BBC Verify team might deal with one particularly interesting online talking point that is currently gaining traction. In keeping with fact-checking tradition, we start with a clear declaration of the ‚Äòmisinformation‚Äô to be debunked:

One of the most recent of false narratives to appear on the internet has been the assertion that 3.0 is greater than 0.85, a view favoured by climate change deniers, seemingly based solely upon a rudimentary understanding of mathematics gained at a very early stage in their education. But is it really true that a number such as 3.0 can be said to be greater than 0.85? In the simplistic world of the fake expert, the answer would be yes, but in the world of climate change risk management, in which the vast majority of the world‚Äôs scientists are in agreement, a much more nuanced and context-driven reality emerges.

The problem with the na√Øve pseudo-mathematics of the climate change denier is that it often fails to understand the true importance of the numbers concerned, but it is only when this importance is taken into account that reliable statements can be made regarding magnitude. The fake experts will point out that when the units are the same, the numbers are directly comparable. But that is where the misdirection is introduced. Using the same units is only part of the issue. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the recent and rapidly spreading online conspiracy theory that 3.0 is greater than 0.85. To get to the bottom of the matter we consulted our specialist disinformation specialists team to find out where this false narrative is coming from and why it is fake news. This is what they had to say:

‚ÄúThis particularly damaging example of misinformation seems to have started with the publication of a study that showed how climate models have predicted that climate change will lead to a 0.85 metre rise in sea level within the next century for the South Eastern city of Jakarta.‚Äù

But is this particular 0.85 actually equal to 0.85? Well, according to our fact-checkers, the answer seems to be ‚Äòprobably‚Äô.

‚ÄúAccording to the models, the figure of 0.85m is the most likely extent of the sea level rise, but the models contain a lot of uncertainties. Accordingly, the value of 0.85 is just a guess. Furthermore, it is based upon a premised 5oC warming relative to 1870, which is far from certain. However, it is a very worrying figure, and that is what is important.‚Äù

Yes, but how does this explain why some deniers have wrongly come to the conclusion that 3.0 is greater than this figure?

‚ÄúWell, if we were dealing with an even greater level of global warming, the models would indeed predict an even greater sea level rise, possibly even 3 metres or more. In such circumstances 3.0 would certainly be greater than 0.85 because that would be an even more worrying impact of climate change. But that is not where this particular 3.0 has come from. This 3.0 is due to the fact that the city of Jakarta has already sunk by over 3 metres in the last 100 years due to subsidence (with 2.5 of that happening in the last decade). And the rate of subsidence is accelerating, so another 100 years may very well result in a further 3 metres of subsidence at the very least.‚Äù

But surely that is a lot more worrying than a 0.85 metre sea-level rise and so this 3.0 is more worrying, and hence it is surely greater than 0.85.

‚ÄúWell, you might think so but you would be applying the na√Øve mathematics of the climate change denier. That is not how climate risk mathematics works because, according to experts, ‚Äúsinking land reinforces the problem of climate change-driven sea-level rise‚Äú. For something to be a reinforcing factor it cannot, by definition, be of greater magnitude than the factor it is reinforcing. If it were, then the reinforcing would be the other way round. And since a land drop of 1 metre is equivalent to a sea-level rise of 1 metre, the only way in which the subsidiary role of subsidence can be explained is by recognising that 3.0 is actually less than 0.85, despite appearances.‚Äù

So is this all about climate change deniers yet again failing to understand how the scientific method works?

‚ÄúCertainly. And it is a classic case of facts being taken out of context to prove a point. It may be a fact that in disciplines such as civil engineering 3.0 is always greater than 0.85, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that the same can be said in climate science, where a huge scientific consensus exists to tell us that sea-level rise due to climate change is the greatest threat faced by coastal cities. Insisting on retaining the narrow (and quite frankly irrelevant) mathematical sense in which 3.0 is greater than 0.85, is tantamount to denying the scientific consensus, and is just typical of the logical flaws employed by the denier. To the layperson, such arguments may appear convincing but to anyone steeped in climate science the claim that 3.0 is greater than 0.85 just doesn‚Äôt make any sense because that would mean that subsidence is a greater problem than climate change-driven sea-level rise, which according to nearly every scientist in the world isn‚Äôt true. That is why, when the BBC reported on this problem it was keen to stress that subsidence only represents a ‚Äòbigger immediate problem‚Äô. In the long term, subsidence is still only reinforcing the problem.‚Äù

Are there any other numbers that climate change deniers are pushing as being greater than 0.85?

‚ÄúYes. Shanghai and New Orleans had both subsided by more than 2 metres in the 20th century, leading climate change deniers to falsely conclude that such cities are more at risk from simply sinking into the sea over the next hundred years than they are from being overwhelmed by a posited 0.85 metre sea-level rise. They also argue that since Shanghai has obviously adapted to its historical 2 metre subsidence without too much fuss and bother, it should also be able to adapt to a 0.85 metres sea-level rise. Once again, these arguments only make superficial sense due to an insistence on sticking to the inappropriate belief that 2.0 is greater than 0.85, thereby denying the consensus within climate science that climate change-driven sea-level rise poses the greatest risk. In fact, there are a host of numbers that have been falsely deemed to be greater than 0.85 based on the likelihood that the majority of coastal cities in the world will, under their own weight, subside by a figure significantly greater than the magnitude of sea-level rise predicted by climate models (albeit, only greater in that consensus-denying mathematical sense beloved of denialists).‚Äù

So there you have it. The science is clear. Climate change will lead to inundation of coastal cities due to sea-level rise unless we immediately abandon fossil fuels. Any suggestion that coastal cities are going to sink anyway, leading to far greater inundations than are predicted by climate models, is a false narrative spread by climate change deniers employing mathematical trickery that fails to take into account the existence of a scientific consensus.

The science is settled. Numbers are just denialist talking points. Consider yourself debunked.

Further Reading:

You may wish to read this for an account of ‚Äòclimate reductionism‚Äô and the problems facing Jakarta. The false narrative that subsidence is merely a reinforcing factor is clearly impeding Jakarta from dealing with its flooding problems.

For the standard, approved narrative, in which the scale of the subsidence problem is downplayed and framed as a reinforcing rather than principal factor, you may wish to read what ClimateCheck has to say on the matter.

1dd4vr6,Open letter to climate deniers,"I really want to do everything in my power to make sure that I am not banned from this subreddit and that my post is not removed, because at the very the least I want to be able to discuss this subject. Therefore, I will be as respectful and honest as I can, but this is a subject that is very close to my heart, and a subject I have spent an exorbitant amount of time reading and studying about.

First, I will give some background. I'm starting my master‚Äôs at DTU in Denmark, where I'm studying material process engineering. I have however been very politically engaged and have had a great interest in all other sciences, climate sciences included. Though I am not an expert in climate sciences or macro-ecology, I can admit that I probably know more than the average person, and even then, I know many people that are legitimate experts.

I want to underline that politically I believe in capitalism. I believe capitalism is the best engine for progress and ultimately is the system that leads to the best standards of living and is the system that respects human rights and personal freedom the most. I absolutely do not think that communism should be adopted anywhere.

I come with this massive disclaimer, because I feel it is important to bridge a political divide, that really shouldn't have become political. The left has adopted environmentalism and twisted it into something different. But that doesn't change the objective reality of our very complicated global situation.

The climate IS changing due to carbon emissions generated by human activity, and the climate is changing at an unprecedented rate. It is probably the most active area of science today, and the data collected from prestige universities around the world, among other highly accredited organizations like NASA, all paint a very clear picture about the climate. There's a 99% consensus among experts, in support of human caused climate change. The data shows that the last time carbon dioxide was emitted at the rate that it is now, was during the Permian Extinction, when the Siberian traps experienced a 'flood basalt event', essentially a massive outflow of lava, but not a volcanic eruption. This lit up giant reservoirs of carbon dioxide eventually leading to a mass extinction.

Obviously this statement of ""human caused climate change"" is not something that can be summarized by a single scientific journal, it's essentially an amalgam of tens of thousands of papers from different fields, all ranging from geology, chemistry and physics but they have all been heavily scrutinized with the same scientific method humanity has also used to develop experimental fusion reactors and to discover incredible things about quantum physics and the universe at large, so the method is clearly not complete bogus.

However, occasionally, scientific papers will emerge that hypothesize something wrong, for example there's been claims that a higher global temperature will result in more frequent and intense hurricanes. This topic has been hotly debated and the science behind it is very speculative, but in all honestly, it's just a detail in the larger picture. I feel that a lot of scepticism and scrutiny on climate change can easily be attributed to speculative and inaccurate research claims that are then pumped up by the media (without consent from the publishers of the science in many cases), where they then become ""evidence"" for the climate being a hoax, after being shown to be inaccurate.

There is however no credible scientific research that shows that AGW, isn't happening that isn't directly funded by the fossil fuel industry, which leads me to ask:

* Isn't it strange that fossil fuel industries have been spending billions on research, for the sole purpose of trying to disprove that fossil fuels have a negative impact on the environment?
* Isn't it strange that these industries, have spent billions on media outlets to push agendas of climate denial? (For example, the Koch family, that is currently worth $115B)
* Why would they even try to do so, if they could be sure that fossil fuels have no negative impact on the environment?
* Who would whoever is behind this climate hoax pay an exorbitant amount of money to make sure that every single research institution makes up false data about the climate?
* How would they even benefit from doing so, and if it was truly the elites that were trying to spread this lie how come the fossil fuel industries is still basically the most powerful and wealthy conglomerate in the world?

To me it seems glaringly obvious that climate change is real, not only from all the scientific data, but also just from turning on the news and seeing all the events from around the world. Forest fires at unprecedented rates, coral reef bleaching, every year has been hottest on record for the past 4 or 5 years the list kind of just keeps going.

My next point is a criticism of environmental activists, and I really want to bring back the point that I feel this issue, which shouldn't have become a political issue is now political. I absolutely disagree with activists, not because I think they are fundamentally wrong, but because I think they poison the well and use this issue to push their personal political agendas (such as communism). In my opinion, I feel it is essential that people separate the issue from the movement. Extremist activists and sensationalist media outlets have often made claims like ""We're all gonna be dead by 2025"" which is false. Statements like this are irresponsible, and are clearly made to garner attention. In reality it's impossible to know exactly when shit really hits the fan or exactly how bad it will be, but experts in economy and geopolitics can all pretty confidently say it will be bad and eventually shit will hit the fan. What we have is an opportunity to not make it worse. Personally I'm of the opinion that we don't wait around and see.

People don't need to massively change their lives on an individual level to combat climate change, it's foolish to believe it would even be possible to MAKE people do so. The most effective change possible would simply be to transition most of the world‚Äôs power to nuclear, and then find alternatives to using cement where possible. That alone could cut something like 40-50% of global emissions and would have absolutely no effect on peoples personal freedoms. Even if you're sceptical of climate change, the effect of carbon pollution on people‚Äôs health alone could be argument enough for transitioning. Pollution from fossil plants were estimated to cause some 10 million deaths each year worldwide.

Funny enough, climate activists insist that nuclear energy should be avoided, likely due to influence from fossil fuel industries, which can be traced way back to Greenpeace in the 1980's. Kind of ironic honestly.

I didn't go into too much detail, but I have a ton of sources that I'll link to if anyone wants to know more on a specific issue. I'm honestly not sure how to do it in this post without going into too much detail and making this whole thing drawn out.

I want to say that I am fucking praying to God that I'm not correct, because honestly I don't want this to happen. This scenario that I see happening is horrific. No matter how much I don't want this to be real, I must take it seriously, because believing something just because you want it to be true is tantamount to burying your head in the sand.

If you really think that climate change isn't real, then I urge you to present your data and research. I will respond respectfully to every comment and message if you give me the same in return. Please pick my post apart and point out where my argument fails, I am not trying to disparage this sub and honestly just want a healthy discussion to take place, because I find this to be the most important topic in 21st century.",0,76,2024-06-10 23:46:59,en

1db7x1v,Why Greenhouse Gasses CANNOT Trap Heat As A Matter Of Principle,"When the atmosphere is heated by the surface, which is heated by the Sun, the following happens:

1. Temperature increases, so within a given density, pressure increases.
2. Pressure is mechanical, caused by gravity, so it is the dominant parameter.
3. In order for pressure to balance, density must decrease.
4. In order for density to decrease, some air must leave into another volume of space.
5. This will repeat the same problem in the new volume of space, however, in order to move, this gas must do work against gravity.
6. Work against gravity converts kinetic to potential energy.
7. Converting kinetic to potential energy cools gas, meaning that while higher altitude gas layers will now become denser thanks to gas rising from below, they'll become colder until pressure is equalized as appropriate for the pressure gradient, and the displacement of gas ceases.

This means that in addition to a pressure gradient caused by gravity, there must also be a potential energy gradient caused by the interaction of thermal energy with gravity as work is done against and with the pressure gradient.

This means that the pressure of a given parcel of air is dominated by densityXtemperature PLUS kinetic/potential energy relative to gravity.

When IR absorbing gases convert radiation into heat, they increase the densityXtemperature parameter, but do not alter the PE/KE parameter. This means that the location of air within the pressure gradient is dominated by PE/KE, which is created by the heat source, whereas IR absorption is dealing with less energy.

What this means is that gas in local equilibrium which is heated without altering its level of potential energy MUST RISE until that heat is exchanged back for potential energy and the molecules become situated in the proper part of the double gradient.

When gases like this rise, it creates space mechanically for colder air from above to exchange down - normally out of equilibrium but not in this case. This conductively cools the lower layer of air.

Because the potential energy gradient is created directly by the heat source, but IR absorption is dealing with a lower energy portion of the spectrum, given these conditions, then NECESSARILY IR absorbing gases MUST cool in an atmospheric system that is transparent to SW radiation.

MOREOVER, EVEN IF back-radiation existed to make the surface stay hotter for longer, the IR absorbing gases would be sorted to appropriate place in the gradient, reducing their temperature to the point where they are not radiating more than what the gradient already does. Thus, by converting absorbed IR to potential energy of gravity, these ""greenhouse gases"" aren't even radiating more than non GHG otherwise would be.

This is why there are no observed hotspots.

EDIT: Reminder, the massive conversion of thermal-kinetic energy into potential energy of gravity is nowhere modeled in the ""climate science"" model of climate. That's all you need to know.",39,7,2024-06-08 13:21:15,en

1d9u3h8,Shady Science: The Dangers of Secret Solar Geoengineering | ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to see a much larger backlash down the road if we do things in a way that is not open and publicly accessible‚Äù,"In the past several years, a few researchers have run small-scale experiments to release aerosols, reflect sunlight, and cool the Earth‚Äîa controversial method called solar geoengineering. In the private sector, one startup has even gone rogue, launching aerosols from a camper van and selling ‚Äúcooling credits‚Äù with little scientific guidance, public engagement, or governmental approval.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to see a much larger backlash down the road if we do things in a way that is not open and publicly accessible,‚Äù said Shuchi Talati, founder and executive director of the Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Geoengineering.

David Kitchen, an expert on climate change at the University of Richmond, said that some researchers might also be hesitant to share their research with the public. The pushback can be so negative that even ‚Äúquite reasonable small-scale experiments‚Äù might not go through.

In an effort from the private sector last year, the U.S. company Make Sunsets launched two weather balloons that injected sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere. The startup, working out of a camper van, flew the balloons over Mexico but didn‚Äôt ask for permission. Afterward, Mexican politicians said the launch violated its sovereignty and enacted a law banning solar geoengineering. The company has continued launching balloons in the U.S., with 64 launches under its belt with little hubbub or fanfare. 
 
As part of its mission of ‚Äúdemocratizing access to Cooling Earth,‚Äù Make Sunsets also sells DIY kits. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not accepting gatekeepers, and we don‚Äôt expect you to either,‚Äù the company wrote in a recent newsletter.

In April, researchers from the University of Washington sprayed sea salt aerosols from the deck of an old aircraft carrier in San Francisco Bay. This small experiment tested whether these particles could brighten clouds, causing them to reflect more sunlight, ultimately leading to cooling. The experimenters didn‚Äôt inform people in the area beforehand‚Äîits launch was kept under wraps to prevent public backlash. But testing has since been paused by the City of Alameda, pending public hearings, according to Alameda Neighborhood News.

Right now, a company or citizen simply needs to fill out a one-page form with the Commerce Department 10 days before injecting particles into the air, which is in line with a law developed in the 1970s. According to the petition, private entities don‚Äôt need to submit the information required to fully assess the risks. Talati called it ‚Äúcompletely insufficient.‚Äù 

Policy experts also worry that the large-scale deployment of solar geoengineering could spark geopolitical conflict. For example, one country might spray an aerosol into the atmosphere to reflect more sunlight in the aftermath of a severe heat wave or other climate disaster, which could have undesirable impacts on other countries.
 
To address this gap, representatives from Switzerland proposed a resolution at February‚Äôs United Nations Environmental Assembly to set up an expert group to ‚Äúexamine risks and opportunities‚Äù of solar geoengineering. The resolution was rejected by Botswana, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Gabon, and Somalia, arguing that solar geoengineering distracts from ‚Äúreal climate solutions.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre already in a time where trust in science and trust in government institutions is at an all-time low,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf we continue to see private institutions, universities and potentially even government‚Äôs doing this in secret, we‚Äôre going to have a lot of problems with misinformation, with trust, and with legitimacy.‚Äù",15,2,2024-06-06 17:45:54,en

1d8s1ja,Microbial polyphenol metabolism is part of the thawing permafrost carbon cycle - Nature Microbiology,"We first emphasize that polyphenols are not a bulk entity, but a diverse class of compounds with distinct impacts. We show that microbial communities engage with this chemical diversity, expressing many substrate-specific enzymes for polyphenols. This contrasts with the PO-centric enzyme latch mechanism, which acknowledges just one enzyme type. Furthermore, rather than a redox binary where anoxia inhibits polyphenol decomposition, we found that microbial communities tuned their gene expression strategies to habitat and redox conditions. 

Therefore, instead of a general antagonistic community response to polyphenols, we illustrated that the microbiome harbours members ranging from polyphenol-inhibited to stimulated. Importantly, we show that rather than shutting down metabolism for the whole microbial community, polyphenols are probably integrated into a larger carbon decomposition network where they serve as substrates, and their decomposition into smaller phenolics could directly fuel carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide production. Rather than relying on a single enzyme, we propose the talented microbiome model where soil microbiomes encode and express a cache of polyphenol metabolisms.

This model raises several questions that should be explored across terrestrial systems. First, the rates of polyphenol removal across the observed transformation pathways remain unknown. Second, the impact of diverse polyphenol degradation pathways for overall carbon storage, the key outcome of the enzyme latch, needs to be examined. Furthermore, the contributions of aerobic and anaerobic fungi to polyphenol degradation should be explored, as well as the direct and indirect impacts of polyphenol metabolism on the methane cycle. We highlight CAMPER as a tool to facilitate detection of genes encoding polyphenol-active enzymes in genomic datasets, enabling researchers to begin addressing these questions in their datasets.

As permafrost carbon stores face uncertain fates with changing climates, we must not assume that portions of carbon are microbially unavailable without also considering the vast enzymatic diversity encoded in soil microbiomes. We highlight this work as a starting place for studying polyphenol dynamics in ecosystem carbon cycles in a post-enzyme latch world. Future assessments of peatland and permafrost microbial carbon cycles should consider the myriad ways that polyphenols support microbial metabolism to better understand and to predict ecosystem biogeochemistry.",1,10,2024-06-05 10:59:38,en

1d7eu5c,"Greenhouse Gas ""Ladder"" To Cool Faster","Pressure dominates an atmospheric lapse rate, because pressure is physical and mechanical.

(Mass(air above) X Gravity) = Pressure at that point in the lapse rate

This results in a logarithmic function defining a pressure lapse rate. I can change densities and temperatures, but these will change relative to each other, governed by the mechanical distribution of pressure.

Here's the ideal gas law:

[p = pressure, V = volume, n corresponds to mass, T = temperature](https://preview.redd.it/llvqa07fxe4d1.png?width=78&format=png&auto=webp&s=01c74350a8cfa09cc741436ba4ebf01d47899081)

Here's density:

https://preview.redd.it/bnp9011nxe4d1.png?width=66&format=png&auto=webp&s=b130fa6bb5362536f26d954840e74b638cd847e4

So pressure is density X temperature.

At a given point in the lapse rate, if the temperature goes up, density will decrease. What's happening is that more energy means the air mass is exerting more pressure, and the pressure lapse rate mechanically sorts this newly pressurized air. The sorting does three things:

1. Decreases density at the point of heating, to restore appropriate pressure.
2. Increase density above the point of heating as air exchanges up the pressure gradient, which would imbalance the pressure there.
3. To resolve #2, this expansion of gas is kinetic work against gravity. Gravity is causing the pressure gradient mechanically, so to expand against it is work against gravity. As this is done, kinetic energy is converted into potential energy of gravity, and the temperature relative to density can decrease. This will then restore the appropriate pressure to the air above the point of heating.

This means that at the point of heating, temperature remains higher than otherwise, with less dense air.

Above the point of heating, temperature is equal or cooler than otherwise, with more dense air. In an open atmosphere, the physical height of the atmosphere rises.

As potential energy converts back into kinetic energy, gas is compressed. Thus, while the now hotter point of heating is radiating energy to space at a faster rate, its temperature is being replenished as density increases due to the atmosphere re-compressing.

The atmosphere is heated by a process of conduction and convection from the surface, which is heated by solar SW radiation.

This solar driven process creates the density gradient *by adding a potential energy gradient.*

So, pressure = density X temperature. However, with the PE gradient this changes.

Now pressure = density X temperature + CompressionFromGravity

Density X temperature is the ""old"" pressure gradient, and the potential energy gradient modifies it. This means that the relationship between density and temperature is no longer logarithmic, but is modified depending on distance from the neutral point in the potential energy gradient. Temperature change will have a greater effect on pressure farther from that neutral point.

This last figure, CfG, changes based on the PE gradient and is negative in the upper troposphere as energy converts into PE and mass gets taken off the scale.

There is a relationship between the temperature of the air and radiative flow. The temperature of Earth's atmosphere *ought* to be the blackbody outflow, around -18C. Therefore, if the temperature is lower than this, then CompressionFromGravity ought to be negative to compensate. Vice versa.

This means that where compression from gravity is 0, you'd find the height of emissions. Here the effect of this expansion of the atmosphere is neutral, thus the temperature reaches its expected blackbody value.

Since solar energy created this density gradient by doing kinetic work against gravity to put PE into the system, therefore it creates a fixed radiative ceiling over the climate at the point where Compression From Gravity is zero.

Thus, adding greenhouse gas to the atmosphere cannot raise the height of effective emissions. Rather, the imbalance caused by IR absorption of gases will rely on the dominant gradient to work like a ""ladder"" to transport IR absorbed energy up above the radiative ceiling. This is effectively a mode of cooling.

The reason why the height of emissions is fixed according to total energy input by the sun, and not affected by atmospheric absorption of LW radiation is for two reasons.

1. Potential energy is non-radiative, so radiative opacity and the radiation budget cannot affect it.
2. The parameters of the atmosphere are determined after SW absorption by the surface, then conduction. LW radiation from the surface is in a substantially lowered energy state, it is on the other side of entropy from what drives the height of emissions.

Thus, IR absorbing ""greenhouse gases"" cool.",12,6,2024-06-03 16:35:10,en

1d6wtcr,"I've Found The ""Boiling Earth"", It's Their False Opacity Model","Imagine these scenarios of how the climate works and what Greenhouse Gases do.

1. GHG alone creates climate. More GHG = more opacity = more energy -> more heat and then finally density catches up to allow for sufficient out-radiation. This is how GHE creates the lapse rate according to the Opacity Model of the Radiative Greenhouse Effect.
2. Reality of physics applied to the Opacity Mode (assume as an inductive thesis that GHG alone creates climate, though not necessarily the climate science model). More energy = more pressure -> change in density lapse rate = sufficient out-radiation without added warming.
3. Inductive conclusion. #2 disproves #1, and #2 is not observed. Therefore, GHG does not create climate. Adopting the gravito-pressure model, insolation creates density lapse rate by hot air doing kinetic work against gravity, and is thermodynamically dominant over any possible LW absorption, which simply helps transport hot air up the density gradient to where there is less opacity. This cools. GHG doesn't create the density gradient, so it instead becomes a ladder on which IR absorbed energy can climb ""faster"" than the kinetic work the rest of the atmosphere is doing against gravity, therefore cooling occurs slightly faster.

Anyway, #1 is what they claim is Earth's climate. #3 is the reality of Earth's climate. #2, when you apply the reality of physics to their claim of how climate works, leads to an interesting result.

Here, *if it is opacity alone* causing the climate (pressure laws selectively suspended), then necessarily there would be a constant churning, a bubbling and boiling of the atmosphere as air constantly bubbles up and over the height of emissions like a boiling pot of water. There it is, the ""boiling"" Earth.

Of course, while smart-alecks make this terrible mistake of physics, in reality, climate science is actually based on the back-radiation model, not the opacity model. In the back radiation model, it's the surface which is re-heated at some rate less than its baseline rate of radiative cooling. This source becomes dominant over the system and lapse rate. Here, pressure actually works as physics says it should, the surface just is hotter than what it would be per blackbody out.

And also, the back-radiation model is wrong. Phew what a mess.

EDIT: The reason why IR absorbed heat doesn't bubble over the height of emissions in reality (gravito-thermal model) is because the lapse gradient is created by a gravity-kinetic effect. The solar energy which has heated the surface and air is pushing up against gravity and gravity is pushing back. This is dominant over absorbed LW, so GHG can't ""boil over"" the dominant gradient, but it can climb up it like a ladder and exchange for colder air higher up the gradient ""trapped"" by the gravity-kinetic effect. Hence GHG cools. 

(cold air ""trapped"" i.e.: would have otherwise exchanged to the surface already if not for the added compression caused by PE of gravity, that is because the atmosphere has been stretched like a spring, there is pressure greater than equilibrium toward the surface and so greater entropy airmasses will struggle to go down this gradient compared to lower entropy airmass, for instance an uplifted adiabatically cooled airmass with high PE of gravity is lower entropy than air which has simply cooled due to systemic radiative cooling, though both can exist at the same altitude; GHG helps the higher entropy airmass exchange faster than the entropy of the system, by climbing the ""ladder"" using the absorbed IR energy, hence overall cooling)

EDIT 2: In the bizzarro opacity model, we are led to believe that all warming comes from IR absorption and the density rate reflects the intersection of total absorption capacity with radiation balance using the ideal gas law. But the problem with this is it puts these dynamics out of sequence and suggests that the opacity itself is holding the energy in. As I stated, what would really happen if the ""ceiling"" of the climate was based on opacity, is air would churn and bubble up over that ceiling since it is a radiative and not physical barrier and gas is material.

Of course when you fully model this with consistent application of pressure laws you just get the gravito-thermal effect and then learn that GHG doesn't create climate.",23,24,2024-06-03 01:13:43,en

1d52p18,"""First, Radiation Is Blocked From Leaving The Earth. Next, There's An Imbalance. Then, The Earth Has To Heat Up In Response."" Ever Wonder Why They Built This Backwards?","Lately we're all hearing about how backradiation isn't a thing with climate change. Instead, it's the *opacity* of the atmosphere with greenhouse gas that creates this sequence of changes that leads to the Earth heating up.

I think it's so funny how they describe it all backwards: Opacity up, photosphere rises, lapse rate creates less emissions, there's an imbalance, the Earth *has* to heat up.

But what is this ""opacity"". When LW doesn't go to space, when it's ""blocked"", what does that mean? There's no opacity, by the way, unless something is blocked.

It surely doesn't mean that the radiation itself is trapped, right? Because it's not like an infinite laser mirror trap machine, right? Since, of course, any ""trapped"" radiation re-scatters back to space in less than a second anyway.

No, opacity means that radiation is being converted into heat. So their little opacity narrative should be: ""Opacity is up, so the air gets hotter, so the Earth cools too slow"". Isn't that simple? Why don't they put it like that?

I'll tell you why. It's because once you start thinking about the air getting hotter, you have to think about atmospheric thermodynamics.

The problem is, the ""height of emissions"" is far below the top of the troposphere. Kinetically energized air masses don't have the same ""ceiling"" that LW radiation has.

This is actually quite important because it begins to explain how the climate actually works. While air is circulating adiabatically, still what mainly happens as air is heated (by the sun) is that the whole atmosphere itself rises and becomes less dense. The lapse rate is fundamentally tied to this.

So the entire ""photosphere rising against the lapse rate"" is a bunch of nonsense that ignores perhaps the most fundamental dynamic of insolated atmosphere.

This is why they state it backwards. They don't want to talk about air heating up because then you have to consider the lapse rate *first,* then ask about emissions. They want to talk about emissions first, take lapse rate for granted, then make a conclusion about temperature.",37,30,2024-05-31 14:34:21,en

1d3s3ll,Alarmist Junk Science's Current Hypothesis As I See It: Ocean Heat Trap,"So, CO2 greenhouse effect makes no sense. There's no ""trap"" associated with air layers absorbing small amounts of energy within the much larger tropospheric climate system driven by the Sun as its heat source. This absorption just gets energy to the end goal a bit more efficiently.

However, you can still build an argument for catastrophic warming even if you discard the greenhouse effect completely. Ready?

1. Because, obviously, GHG don't trap heat, really what we have to say is that human industrialization and the urban heat island effect at scale, plus perhaps some transitional-we-don't-really-know greenhouse like effect from pollution somehow makes the daytime hours in many regions slightly hotter.
2. Of course this slight heat escapes to space at night in the end anyway. However, some of that slight human caused temporary somehow-pollution-related heat ends up making the oceans a bit warmer.
3. WEEELLLLLL, oceans retain heat, and hide it away deep below the waves where we really don't know what's going on down there.
4. SSSSOOOOOOO, over years and decades that hidden secret heat will blast back and release all at once, which will of course trigger systemic feedbacks as Gaia undergoes trauma.

As far as I can tell, this is basically their best argument. I know to scientifically ignorant warmists, this appears to be a strawman because of a bit of ironic tone along with straight dismissiveness of their junk science. However, remove the ironic tone, and then realize that warmist science really is junk science.

1d2ddqt,Around half the world could lose easily accessible groundwater by 2050,"15 May 2024
*They used a model that incorporates the intricate relationships between groundwater extraction, economic development, energy systems and climate change*

Club of Rome stuff

For those behind a paywall ‚Ä¶
>Groundwater extraction is set to peak globally within the next three decades as unsustainable pumping depletes accessible stores. This could reshape the food and water systems that serve at least half the world‚Äôs population.
Between 1960 and 2010, global groundwater extraction increased by more than 50 per cent, largely to irrigate crops. Today, one-fifth of all food is produced using groundwater. Much of this water is extracted from aquifers faster than they naturally refill, driving declining water levels. This causes the land to sink, contaminates the remaining water and harms ecosystems fed by the aquifers. It also increases the cost of extraction ‚Äî wells must be drilled ever deeper and water pumps require more energy.

>Previous studies projected this groundwater extraction would rise indefinitely, but they ‚Äúdid not have the human feedback in there‚Äù, says Hassan Niazi at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington state.

>Niazi and his colleagues projected how decreasing water levels and rising pumping costs could affect extraction in the world‚Äôs major water basins this century. They used a model that incorporates the intricate relationships between groundwater extraction, economic development, energy systems and climate change. The researchers modelled 900 different scenarios to capture a range of possible futures.
>On average across scenarios, they found the volume of groundwater extraction peaked around 2050 at 625 cubic kilometres of water ‚Äî about twice as much as today. By century‚Äôs end, extraction declined to near present-day level. The peak‚Äôs timing and magnitude varied across scenarios, but nearly all forecasted a peak before 2100.

>Some regions may face even quicker declines. In most scenarios, extraction peaked before 2030 in 10 per cent of studied water basins, including in large areas of India, Pakistan and China. Extraction in some basins appears to have already peaked. The researchers found declining extraction volumes in Missouri and California since 2010 and 2015, respectively.
‚ÄúWhat is driving that peak really differs region to region,‚Äù says Niazi. In California, for example, increasing pumping costs appears to be the main cause. In South-East Asia, shifts in precipitation and hotter temperatures due to climate change play a larger role, he says.

>The researchers were clear that it is impossible to drain all the planet‚Äôs groundwater ‚Äì they project people will pump less than 1 per cent of the water present in the top 2 kilometres of Earth‚Äôs crust over the next century. But supplies that are economically or physically feasible to extract could run short, impacting agricultural and water systems.
Food prices could rise, for instance. That may spur more agriculture on rain-fed lands or compel drier countries to import water-intensive crops. Regions that haven‚Äôt pumped much groundwater might start pumping more.
>‚ÄúThose changes aren‚Äôt going to be easy,‚Äù says Peter Gleick at the Pacific Institute, a non-profit research organisation in California. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just move that agricultural production to somewhere else‚Äù in most cases, he says.
>Alongside factors like climate change and a growing population, the impact on food availability could be ‚Äúvery alarming‚Äù, says Matti Kummu at Aalto University in Finland. Food producers should switch to less water-intensive crops and use groundwater more efficiently as soon as possible, he says.",28,20,2024-05-28 03:02:58,en

How: with the major shift in the US Supreme Court composition to more conservative justices, willing to reverse other past decisions. It‚Äôs time to relitigate this issue and take it up to the Supreme Court with all the research showing that CO2 is a plant fertilizer and is critical to plant growth. Plus, the reinterpretation of past historical temperatures, and CO2 levels as totally destroying the myths of the past declaring CO2 as a pollutant at all.

Reason: the United States Supreme Court triggered a lot of the climate alarmism when its past decisions declared that carbon dioxide was a pollutant. That authorized the EPA to go forward with all of its regulatory power, to combat the ‚Äúpollution‚Äú.

1cxaouh,"Climate Is Caused By Tall Tropospheres, Not A Radiative Greenhouse","I've said this a few times but thought a simple treatment was due.

Here's what causes climate: air heated at the surface does work against gravity. The higher temperatures within the pressure gradient lead to less air density. This is the work done, making the air less dense. The height of the troposphere rises.

The air which rises against the baseline state then fall, gravity does work against gas, compressing it. This is compression beyond the baseline. There is force in that compression more than what gravity was accomplishing in the baseline state, because air is falling, becoming more dense. This heats the surface.

The potential energy of gravity, the store of solar energy in the form of a taller troposphere, does not radiate. So it must be balanced by a hotter, more radiative surface.

In summary, when an atmosphere is heated, its troposphere rises and stores energy against gravity, and subsequently the surface becomes hotter.

The blackbody energy out temperature would be the average temperature and exist somewhere in between the surface and top of troposphere.

There's no room for a top of atmosphere heat trap. The height of emissions is far below the top of the troposphere, so the alleged photospherical heat trap is not thermally isolated. Colder air above the heat trap could cool the air below through normal kinetic means.

If the height of emissions reached the top of the troposphere somehow, then the height of the troposphere would simply rise. It would have risen long before that could happen. So there's no meaningful effective IR heat trap in any general Terran style atmosphere. There are no conditions under which an atmosphere like this could be subject to an IR heat trap. Thus, IR active gases will always serve merely to promote more efficient regional cooling.",15,10,2024-05-21 11:30:58,en
1cx9w5f,Why IR Opacity/Height of Emissions Explanation Is Totally Wrong,"For some reason, warmists are now backing away from ""back-radiation"" in their explanation of why CO2 controls climate. This is of course silly because IR radiation travels nearly instantaneously, and scatters bidirectionally, so even an atmosphere that's opaque to IR wouldn't block that energy for very long. The ""back-radiation"" has to be absorbed by the lower layers or else this opacity wouldn't create warming.

Here's how they dodge that: ""Since less energy is able to escape into space, the Earth must get warmer."" In other words, by magic, ""trust us."" No, of course what they mean is that the back-radiation is getting absorbed which is why it's not escaping into space, and also what they Earth gets warmer. Think about the stupidity of a radiation trap where energy bounces back and forth in the atmosphere and never warms anything, like a perpetual laser bouncing off mirrors in a circle.

In any event, here's why IR opacity is not a good explanation for warming: you can't create more heat than what comes from the original heat source.

The idea of opacity says that more heat is trapped closer to the surface, meaning the area above the ""height of emissions"" would be colder. You can't create more heat, you're just changing where the heat is. The ""photosphere"" is within the troposphere so this heat-trapped region isn't exactly thermally isolated either.

No, the back-radiation explanation was and will always be the only plausible way to claim greenhouse gases cause warming. This is because the scientifically incorrect back-radiation warming premise allows for the multiplication of heat above and beyond the source.",13,17,2024-05-21 10:57:32,en

1cw4piu,Hot Surface Air Does Work Against Gravity,"The pressure gradient is fixed, due to gas laws. The surface square meter of air faces a force of pressure equal to the mass of the air column above it times gravity. That never changes, so the pressure doesn't change. If you did move air around by heating it up or cooling it, it moves within a pressure gradient determined by this basic mass x gravity = force of pressure phenomenon. Kinetically energetic molecules can increase pressure, but the gradient, the change in pressure over height due to gravity against the surface, is the anchor.

This is discussed more or less, here: [The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol. I Ch. 40: The Principles of Statistical Mechanics (caltech.edu)](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_40.html)

If you add energy to air, the increase in temperature has to correspond to a change in density forced by the pressure gradient. In other words, a hotter troposphere will expand to be taller, reaching higher up the pressure gradient. Lower density replaces some mass with kinetic force. Indeed, the amount of kinetic force from higher temperatures is equivalent to the change in density against the previous state within the pressure gradient. It's how much more air can push up on the column of air above it.

This is Work against gravity. Often when this is brought up people complain about this in terms of the energy budget. Well, let's think in those terms. If Work is done against gravity, and air is pushed up higher, then energy is being stored as PE of gravity. This would have to balance by Work being done against the surface as molecules fall. This work means greater compression of surface molecules AKA they become hotter than the average radiation out based on a blackbody calculation.

It HAS to be this way for the energy budget to be balanced. Air CANNOT rise higher and attain lower density WITHOUT heating up the surface.

HOWEVER, the less density air uplifting not ONLY cools adiabatically, but - warmists neglect this part - builds Potential Energy. Potential Energy is a store of energy that does not radiate, but is also not incorporated in the adiabatic change. Adiabatic change to an air mass won't affect its total out radiation. It will radiate less (cooler), but over a wider area. However, uplifted air exchanges for potential energy, so some energy will be stored without radiating. For the radiative energy budget to be balanced, the surface has to be hotter than the average, due to potential energy.

Again, this is simply the idea that uplifted air does Work against gravity, so there must be a corresponding Work done against surface air, compressing and heating it beyond a mere adiabatic-geometric compression. When air uplifts it is not MERELY adiabatically cooling, but also doing Work against gravity. It's cooling via both channels.

EDIT: Warmists only consider the adiabatic cooling occurring as air uplifts to the top of the troposphere, which is balanced by adiabatic heating at the surface. Since radiation out is not affected by adiabatic change, they see a balanced energy budget here and do not incorporate it into their Trenberth style energy budgets. All they have is a special category for thermals.

However they are wrong because it's not merely adiabatic cooling, but adiabatic and gravitational. Energy is lost to gravity. ""But that energy doesn't just disappear"" they usually say. They're right, it returns in the form of a hotter surface. 

The ""back-radiation"" ""greenhouse"" thermal effect in the Trenberth model comes from them ignoring the massive convection of air on the basis of it being budget-neutral as purely adiabatic. In fact, there is a relationship between zero radiative potential energy of gravity, and hotter surface temperatures.",8,4,2024-05-19 22:13:00,en

1cvb2hv,What If The Global Average Temperature Doesn't Actually Exist?,"Consider the day to night, equator to pole, season to season change in temperature. The system average for these has to be within a probability distribution that, while steep, isn't steep enough for a certain level of precision. I'm sure this can be calculated.

This would be a situation where if some range, like any changes to observable system averages (or unstable average) greater than 10C might meaningfully correspond to a system change. However, anything less than a 10C change would not indicate any measurable system change.

Does this make sense? That the ""global average surface temperature"" doesn't exist within a certain range of precision, that is it an inherently chaotic number which requires a certain range to qualify as a meaningful indicator of trends.

The average temps the warmists use rely on their hypothetical model of climate and other tinkering, to calibrate the homogenization to confirm their hypothesis, if that makes sense. This methodology would fall short more clearly if we understood that homogenization under a certain level of precision is impossible and the value of a global system average more precise than some value (say, 10C) doesn't exist in any meaningful way in reality.

  
EDIT: to clarify, I‚Äôm saying that the earth‚Äòs ‚Äúaverage temperature‚Äù as a product of its climate system equilibrium, is driven by cycles as well as chaos. That chaos introduces some error margin that can NEVER be corrected for. Only when a change greater than that margin is observed, can the system be said to have changed its equilibrium.

  
In other words no statistically significant equilibrium value exists at a certain level of high precision. The system itself never equilibrates that precisely. So, if temperature anomaly models claim an anomaly within that level of precision they‚Äôre full of crap. ",36,82,2024-05-18 20:05:48,en

154q8w7,Respekt und Sachlichkeit als Grundlage des Austauschs in diesem Sub. Oder: Warum wir jetzt strenger moderieren.,"Liebe Klimawandel-Community.

Im letzten Monat hat sich die Zahl der Nutzer und Nutzerinnen hier im Sub vervielfacht. W√§hrend es hier lange recht ruhig war, ist hier nun oft sehr viel los, teils zig oder gar hunderte Kommentare. Das ist toll! 

Jedoch: Oft sind die Diskussionen sehr aufgeheizt, unsachlich und respektlos. Wir wollen hier daher k√ºnftig st√§rker moderieren und wollen Euch hier unsere Gedanken dazu vorstellen.

**Der Klimawandel ist Realit√§t und eine riesige Herausforderung f√ºr die Menschheit.**

Dies ist die Grundlage dieses Subs: Der Klimawandel ist real und mit allergr√∂√üter Wahrscheinlichkeit auf die menschliche Beeinflussung des Klimasystems zur√ºckzuf√ºhren. F√ºr uns Mods ist die Klimakrise eine der gr√∂√üten Herausforderungen der Menschheitsgeschichte und wir halten es f√ºr alles andere als gewiss, dass die Menschheit es schafft, dieser Herausforderung in angemessener Weise zu begegnen.

**Sachlichkeit und Respekt als Basis des Austauschs im Sub...**

Dieser riesigen Herausforderung wird man in einem Klimawandel-Sub aus unserer Sicht am ehesten dadurch gerecht, dass hier ein respektvoller und sachlicher Umgang herrschen sollte. Wer sich daran nicht h√§lt, wird sanktioniert. Das gilt grunds√§tzlich f√ºr jede inhaltliche √Ñu√üerung.

**... auch anderen Meinungen gegen√ºber.**

Wir m√ºssen anerkennen, dass es Menschen gibt, die den Klimawandel f√ºr weniger relevant halten. Oder die Fragen an die Klimawissenschaft haben. Wir finden es wichtig, dass auch mit diesen Menschen ein Austausch stattfinden kann. 

F√ºr die Leugnung des anthropogenen Klimawandels ist dies grunds√§tzlich der falsche Sub, entsprechende √Ñu√üerungen werden regelm√§√üig gel√∂scht. Aber: Wer respektvoll und sachlich Fragen zu Details des Klimawandels oder der Klimawissenschaft hat, ist herzlich eingeladen, diese zu stellen. Und auch, wenn Ihr entsprechende √Ñu√üerungen f√ºr Quatsch haltet, bleibt bitte trotzdem sachlich und respektvoll, sonst m√ºssen wir eingreifen.

**Dieser Sub wird ab sofort stark moderiert.**

Wir haben in der letzten Zeit schon mit st√§rkerem Durchgreifen begonnen und m√∂chten unsere Linie hier jetzt √∂ffentlich machen. Da das Thema h√§ufig polarisiert, heizen sich die Diskussionen hier im Sub teils sehr auf, h√§ufig sind Sachlichkeit und Respekt nicht mehr gegeben. Um dies k√ºnftig so weit wie m√∂glich zu minimieren, werden wir k√ºnftig deutlich st√§rker durchgreifen.

Grunds√§tzlich folgen wir dabei folgendem Stufen-Ansatz:

* Vorstufe: L√∂schung von Beitr√§gen, die nicht den Regeln entsprechen
* Stufe: Tempor√§res Bannen von Nutzer und Nutzerinnen, die gegen Regeln versto√üen
* 2. Stufe: Permanentes Bannen Nutzer und Nutzerinnen, die gegen Regeln versto√üen

Wir behalten uns vor, Nutzer und Nutzerinnen, die in besonders krasser Weise gegen die Sub-Regeln versto√üen, sofort zu permabannen. Dazu geh√∂rt insbesondere platte Klimawandelleugnung, die auf kein Interesse an einem sachlichen Austausch schlie√üen l√§sst. Wer nach einem Bann sachlich darlegen kann, dass der Versto√ü gegen Regeln nur ein tempor√§rer war, kann uns gerne per Modmail kontaktieren. 

**! Wir sind auf Eure Hinweise angewiesen !**

Wir k√∂nnen nicht alle Diskussionen hier im Sub mitlesen. Darum sind wir auf Eure Meldungen gegen Regelverst√∂√üe angewiesen.

**Moderatoren gesucht.**

Wer diesen Ansatz zur Moderation mittragen und uns bei der Moderation unterst√ºtzen m√∂chte, kann uns gerne √ºber Modmail Bescheid geben.",25,19,2023-07-20 08:58:54,de

1eudoqn,"Eine Antwort zu Doomerismus und der Position, man k√∂nne ja eh nichts mehr retten","Es gibt ja viele Stimmen, die sagen, dass eh nichts mehr zu retten sei. Nur als Beispiel mal /u/zogaboys59 in [diesem Kommentar](https://old.reddit.com/r/de/comments/1etpsht/die_viel_zu_warmen_meere_sind_unser_aller_problem/ligki8k/).

Was ich dazu meine:

/u/yogaboys69 : Nicht vergessen, dass es schon lange auch eine explizite PR Strategie der fossilen Industrie ist (unter anderen Strategien, wie [der gezielten F√∂rderung der Rechten](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/15/shell-oil-project-2025-climate-crisis)), Doom-Stimmung zu verbreiten, und dass man nichts machen k√∂nne.

Dass wir nicht so weiter machen k√∂nnen wie gehabt, ist richtig. Wie aber die Zukunft aussieht, h√§ngt ganz wesentlich von unserer kollektiven Antwort und kollektiven Prozessen ab. Und die sind gerade wenn es um grosse oder lang dauende Ver√§nderungen geht, nicht vorhersagbar. F√ºnf Beispiele:

* [Perestroika](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika) und der Zerfall des Stalinismus und des sowjetischen Blocks um 1989. Das h√§tte noch 1984 niemand vorausgesehen und war die gr√∂√üte politische Ver√§nderung der letzten 75 Jahre.
* Das [international kopierte Einspeisegesetz (EEG)](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz) und die folgende weltweite massive F√∂rderung der Windenergie.
* Der [atemberaubende Preisverfall bei Solarmodulen](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth), das Erreichen von [Solar Grid Parity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_parity) und der dadurch ausgel√∂ste weltweite absolute Boom bei carbonfreier Stromerzeugung
* die [massiven Fortschritte bei der Batterietechnik](https://www.golem.de/news/akkutechnik-catl-stellt-erste-natrium-ionen-akkus-fuer-autos-vor-2107-158529.html). Zusammen mit den beiden vorstehenden Faktoren f√ºhrt der gerade zu einer rapiden und massiven Decarbonisierung der weltweiten Stromerzeugung.
* Der [rasante Umstieg von Grosst√§dten wie Amsterdam](https://www.wired.com/story/car-free-cities-opposition/), Kopenhagen, [Paris](https://english.elpais.com/lifestyle/2024-04-24/the-cycling-revolution-in-paris-continues-bicycle-use-now-exceeds-car-use.html#https://english.elpais.com/lifestyle/2024-04-24/the-cycling-revolution-in-paris-continues-bicycle-use-now-exceeds-car-use.html%23), Lyon, Barcelona, Br√ºssel weg vom Auto und zu Fahrrad und √ñPNV als Transportmittel.

Es gibt also bereits gewaltige Ver√§nderungen - auch solche, welche die √∂konomischen etablierten Verh√§ltnisse auf den Kopf stellen, wie die fossile Stromerzeugung. Klar ist, da kommen spannende Zeiten auf uns zu - aber wir stehen eben nicht am Ende der Geschichte sondern in einer Krise, in der jede Handlung und jedes Wort doppelt z√§hlt..",48,71,2024-08-17 05:27:05,de

1eti6d8,"Eine √úberlegung zum Thema ""Individuelle Massnahmen gegen√ºber kollektiven Massnahmen"" - Immanuel Kants ethischer Grundsatz der Aufkl√§rung als Mittel zum kollektiven Wandel","Es gibt ja immer das Argument, dass individueller Verzicht auf CO2-emittierende Aktivit√§ten (wie z.B. Fleisch zu essen, zu fliegen, oder im Winter auf schnuckelige 23 Grad zu heizen) angeblich ""nichts bringe"" und dass dies ja doch eine b√∂se Kampagne von Big Oil w√§re, die nur alle (unwidersprochen notwendigen) kollektiven Anpassungen auf Einzelne abw√§lzt. Was man gleich dagegen einwenden kann, dass Big Oil nat√ºrlich weder individuelle noch kollektive Ver√§nderungen mag, denn beides bedeutet weniger Profite.

Ich habe hier eine Analogie zu bieten, die das Verst√§ndnis der Situation vielleicht erhellt. Ein Gedankenexperiment mit einer Parallel-BRD:

Angenommen, wir w√§ren eine Bundesrepublik mit moderner Technik und so weiter, wie in Wirklichkeit. Aber, und im Unterschied, wir w√ºrden immer noch, wie bis zum 18. Jahrhundert, Abw√§sser aus dem Nachttopf und Sp√ºlbecken ungekl√§rt aus dem Fenster kippen. Nat√ºrlich w√ºrde das furchbar stinken. (Ja, das tat es.) Und deswegen g√§be es regelm√§ssig Cholera-Pandemien mit vielen Toten (die es ja [im 19. Jahrhundert auch real gab, mit verheerenden Folgen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera#Cholera-Pandemien)). Ein paar kluge Wissenschaftler und Hygiene-Forscher w√ºrden herausfinden, dass das an ansteckenden Bakterien liegt, die durch verdrecktes Trinkwasser √ºbertragen werden, und w√ºrden konsequente Abwasserentsorgung vorschlagen.

Und nun g√§be es eine breite gesellschaftliche Diskussion und einen (wenn auch von strikten Pi√ütopf-Bef√ºrwortern und Wissenschaftsleugnern - unsere Parallel-BRD w√§re ja auch pluralistisch - angefochtenen) generellen Konsens ""Hm, Abwasser aus dem Fenster kippen ist ja eigentlich nicht so gut, und sollte eigentlich abgeschafft und durch eine vern√ºnftige Kanalisation ersetzt werden"". Also eine kollektive Aufgabe. Aber die Politik k√§me irgendwie nicht so recht in die P√∂tte (vielleicht aufgrund der Parteispenden der Pi√ütopf-Industrie, oder von Wohnungsgesellschaften welche die Mehrausgabe scheuen).

Jeder kann sich denken, was die Querdenker und Nuerechten der Parallel-Bundesrepublik dazu meinen t√§ten, aber das interessiert mich gar nicht. Nicht einen Furz.

Die Frage, die ich aufwerfen m√∂chte, lautet vielmehr:

Ist es in Anbetracht der **kollektiven** Aufgabe sinnvoll, als **individuellen** Schritt **selber auf die unhygienische Abwasserentsorgung zu verzichten**? Auch wenn dies allein das **kollektive** Problem nicht l√∂st? Und die Kosten beim Einzelnen liegen?

Ein gro√üer Philosoph der Aufkl√§rung, n√§mlich Kant, hatte eine Position dazu. Er gab dieser [einen sehr sperrigen Namen, n√§nlich ""kategorischer Imperativ""](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorischer_Imperativ), aber der Gedanke ist einfach. Um ihn in meinen Worten zu beschreiben:

**""Verhalte dich stets so, dass es w√ºnschenswert w√§re, dass die Grunds√§tze deines Verhaltens allgemeines Gesetz w√ºrden.""**

Das ist nur etwas komplexer als ""Was Du nicht willst, was man dir tu, das f√ºg auch keinem anderm zu"", das Grundschulkinder lernen.

Es klingt banal, aber ich denke dieses Prinzip ist viel tiefer als es aussieht, denn aufgekl√§rte (und nur deswegen freie), moderne Gesellschaften beruhen in ihrer Existenz grundlegend auf:

1. Vern√ºnftiger, rationaler Einsicht
2. Kooperation.

Nun kann man argumentieren, das mit dem Abwasser sei doch Pippifax (ha!), und w√ºrde doch nicht vergleichbar sein mit der Bequemlichkeit und den √∂konmischen Vorteilen der fossilen Energietr√§ger. Wenn so argumentiert wird, kann man gerne etwas anderes nehmen, was vergleichbare Eigenschaften hat, und aus guten Gr√ºnden abgeschafft wurde, wie etwa die Sklaverei in Nordamerika. Allerdings ist das mit dem Abwasser ein guter Vergleich zum CO2 Problem, denn das Problem nicht zu l√∂sen hat sehr gravierende, lebensver√§ndernde Folgen f√ºr uns alle. (Auf der anderen Seite zeigt das Beispiel der Sklaverei einen anderen Aspekt besser auf, den der Ungerechtigkeit, denn ein Vielfaches der Ressourcen der meisten Erdenbewohner zu verbrauchen, auf Kosten derer Lebensgrundlagen ist nicht nur strohdumm sondern auch massiv ungerecht, und aus meiner Sicht wegen der massiven Folgen f√ºr Eigentum, Wohlergehen und Gesundheit eine Form von Gewalt.)

Es wird selbstverst√§ndlich immer Leute geben, die das Festhalten an solchen ""Traditionen"" bef√ºrworten, weil es ihnen pers√∂nliche Vorteile bringt. Aber ist dies, gemessen an Kants Grundsatz haltbar? Denn man darf ja nicht vergessen, dass auch wenn das bessere Verhalten des Einzelnen das kollektive Problem nicht l√∂st, ja trotzdem der **Schaden**, den er Einzelne mit seinem Verhalten verursacht, ganz real ist.",2,24,2024-08-16 02:56:14,de

Dabei ist mir wieder der Gedanke gekommen, warum man nicht einfach Biomasse zu Kohle verarbeitet und die speichert. Nach ein paar Minuten Recherche bin ich ich auf den Carbon Twister gesto√üen.  
[https://www.carbon-twister.com/technologie-und-produkte/f-500-pro](https://www.carbon-twister.com/technologie-und-produkte/f-500-pro)

Das ist ein recht primitives System. F√ºr Pyrolyse braucht man laut Gemini 300¬∞-800¬∞ C, was man mit konzentrierter Solarenergie auch hinbekommt. Stichwort daf√ºr ist Solar Thermal Pyrolysis wof√ºr man auch Ans√§tze findet zur Biodieselerzeugung.

Das mag vielleicht nicht die effizienteste oder wirtschaftlichste L√∂sung sein, aber sie ist einfach. Und wenn man √ºbersch√ºssiges Biomaterial, wie Gr√ºnschnitt teilweise verheizt zur Verkohlung bleibt unterm Strich immernoch ein negativer CO2 Aussto√ü f√ºr die Atmosph√§re √ºbrig.

Mit Isolierung und W√§rmer√ºckgewinnung l√§sst sich das sicher auch noch effizienter gestalten.

Bei der sog. WDR BusTour 2024 f√§hrt Herr Dassel f√ºr den WDR mit einem 47 Jahre alten VW T1 Bus monatelang quer durch Europa. W√ºrde er das privat machen, w√ºrde ich mir niemals irgendeinen Kommentar anma√üen. Aber Klima schrotten f√ºr den WDR, mit Beitragsgeldern, geht's noch?

[Christian Dassel vor dem VW T1 Bus f√ºr die WDR BusTour 2024](https://preview.redd.it/hi6a329k5oid1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee92410f8e512f8df108072613cda533f6541015)

Die WDR BusTour, eine kuriose Mischung aus Steimle's Welt und mareTV, h√§tte qualitativ sicherlich keinerlei Auswirkung gehabt, wenn man auf den modernen VW ID Buzz mit √ñkostrom gewechselt w√§re. Vielleicht h√§tte das sogar den ein oder anderen Technikbegeisterten angezogen.

So bleibt der WDR wie er ist: ewiggestriger Klimas√ºnder. W√§re ja fast komisch, wenn daran nicht die Welt zugrunde gehen w√ºrde und wir das auch noch mit unserem Rundfunkbeitrag subventionieren m√ºssten.",0,19,2024-08-14 14:08:02,de
1er5epq,B√ºcher und Dokus zum Klimawandel in einfacherer Sprache,"Ich lese gerade mal wieder ein Buch zum Thema Klimawandel (Unlearn CO2, kann es bisher empfehlen). Was mir bei den bisher gelesenen B√ºchern zu dem Thema auff√§llt, ist dass sie sich an ein Publikum mit h√∂herem Bildungsgrad richten. Sie sind ja auch oft von Wissenschaftlern geschrieben und entsprechend gehalten. 

Jetzt will ich aber mal meinen Eltern was zu dem Thema empfehlen. Beide sind Migranten mit ganz guten Deutschkenntnissen f√ºr den Alltag und ihre Jobs, haben in ihrem Heimatland einen Volksschulabschluss und eine Art schulische Ausbildung gemacht. Denen w√§ren B√ºcher wie Das Klimabuch oder Unlearn CO2 einerseits zu hoch. Andererseits werden in den genannten B√ºchern auch das Thema Klimakrise mit Themen wie Feminismus, Ableism, Minderheiten etc gemischt. Da gibt es wenig Ber√ºhrungspunkte und evtl auch Desinteresse zu den Themen. Glaube auch dass es auf einige Menschen eher absto√üend wirken kann. 

Deshalb die Frage ob jemand B√ºcher oder auch Dokumentationen kennt die einen guten √úberblick √ºber das Problem zeigen und sich nicht allzuviel mit ""Nebenkriegsschaupl√§tzen"" (so wichtig die Themen auch sind!) besch√§ftigt. Dazu noch in etwas einfacherer Sprache. Bin √ºber jeden Tip dankbar. 


Disclaimer, Bevor mir vorgeworfen wird, ich w√ºrde Themen wie Feminismus nicht ernst nehmen: Das tue ich absolut.

1eawf9o,100 Unternehmen sind Schuld am Klinawandel,"Dieser abgedroschene und oberfl√§chliche ‚ÄúFun‚Äù Fact kursiert st√§ndig in den sozialen Medien und scheint das nutzloseste, wenn nicht sogar aktiv sch√§dlichste Klimameme zu sein. Es ignoriert Angebot und Nachfrage komplett und somit unsere kollektive Mitschuld an der Klimakrise. Die 100 Unternehmen, die f√ºr den Klimawandel verantwortlich gemacht werden, sind keine b√∂sen Fabriken, die zum Spa√ü Treibhausgase produzieren und Arten ausrotten. Es sind riesige Firmen, die unser modernes Leben erm√∂glichen, mit allem Guten, Schlechten und allem dazwischen. Dieses Meme und die dazugeh√∂rige Einstellung f√ºhren nur dazu, dass die Leute die H√§nde in die Luft werfen und sagen: ‚ÄúNa ja, 100 Unternehmen sind schuld, warum sollte ich mein Verhalten √§ndern? Ich kann genauso gut √ºbers Wochenende nach Malle fliegen, und auf Amazon bestellen, was ich will. Es ist die Schuld der Konzerne‚Äù, ohne ihre eigene Mitschuld zu erkennen. Aber wohin flie√üt das Geld im Malle-Flug? Zu Ryan Air, und die kaufen bei Exxon Kerosin und bei Boeing Flugzeuge. In anderen Worten: Zu Unternehmen, die bei diesen 100 Unternehmen all das kaufen, was sie brauchen, um dir deinen Komfort zu erm√∂glichen.

Wir, genauso wie die Konzerne, Regierungen und Pr√§sidenten, sind alle Zahnr√§der im Getriebe der globalen Zivilisation und Teil dieses unl√∂sbaren Puzzles, das uns in Richtung Selbstzerst√∂rung f√ºhrt.

1duk372,Ein paar Gedanken zum Klimawandel ,"Ich befasse mich seit einigen Jahren intensiv mit dem Thema Klimawandel, Geoengineering, etc. Ich hatte echt sehr lange jegliche Hoffnung verloren. Bis so vor 1-2 Jahren ist mir klar geworden ist, dass wir zwar gegen den Klimawandel etwas tun k√∂nnen aber solange nicht alle L√§nder mitmachen das Ganze doch relativ aussichtslos wird. Jeder kann seinen Teil beitragen (so viel er kann), dass wir die Folgen abfedern k√∂nnen. Aufhalten werden wir diesen nicht mehr. Wir m√ºssen viel mehr versuchen mit den Folgen zu leben bzw. Ma√ünahmen ergreifen den Klimawandel ""ertr√§glicher"" zu machen. Das geht vor allem durch technischen Fortschritt, z.B. K√ºstenschutz und Wohlstand, der es den Leuten erm√∂glicht besser mit den Folgen umzugehen oder gar nicht erst Opfer zu werden. Die Todeszahlen nach Naturkatastrophen sinken √ºbrigens seit Jahren, vor allem bedingt durch bessere Versorgung, Wohlstand, etc. (Quelle und Buchempfehlung: Factfullness von Hans Rosling)
Ein weiterer Punkt ist, dass die Bev√∂lkerung keineswegs mehr ewig wachsen wird. Wahrscheinlich erreichen wir gerade so die 9 Milliarde in den 50er Jahren dieses Jahrhunderts. Danach geht's bergab. China alleine wird 600 Mio. Menschen verlieren bis 2100. Ich bin inzwischen der Meinung, dass die Welt sich selbst wieder ins Gleichgewicht bringt. Wir werden durch den technischen Fortschritt M√∂glichkeiten entwickeln den Klimawandel abzufedern. In der Vergangenheit der Menschheit wurde jede Herausforderung √ºber einen Prozess wieder ins Gleichgewicht gebracht. Uns wird es nichts bringen den Kopf in den Sand zu stecken und in Selbstmitleid zu verfallen, weil das Bringt uns √ºberhaupt nichts.

Die Produktion und der Konsum von Fleisch sind ja nach aktuellen Statistiken recht intensiv was CO2-Emissionen angeht und tragen somit signifikant zur Klimaerw√§rmung bei. Aber woraus resultiert das genau?

Die Tiere geben doch beim Konsum nur soviel CO2 frei, wie sie auch vorher √ºber das Futter aufgenommen haben. Und anschlie√üend wird das CO2 wieder von den Futterpflanzen aufgenommen. Es bleibt theoretisch ein eigener kleiner Kreislauf.

Weiteres CO2 wird doch haupts√§chlich √ºber die Verwendung der Maschinen mit fossiler Energie zugef√ºhrt. Auch die Umwandlung beispielsweise in Methan w√§re noch als zus√§tzlicher Faktor zu nennen.

W√ºrde man also Strom/Landmaschinen mit regenerativen Energien betreiben, dann w√§re doch die Fleischproduktion fast klimaneutral, oder? Ich kanns mir irgendwie nicht wirklich vorstellen. Wo ist bitte mein Denkfehler dabei?",7,47,2024-06-25 03:42:38,de

1dlps9w,"Von wem, wo und warum werden Klimaschutz Ma√ünahmen behindert?","Die Antworten sind sehr komplex und k√∂nnen verschiedene Perspektiven ber√ºcksichtigen. Es gibt jedoch einige allgemeine Gr√ºnde, die von verschiedenen Akteuren genannt werden:

1. **Wirtschaftliche Interessen -** Wirtschaftliche Interessen - Einige Unternehmen, insbesondere in Branchen, die stark von fossilen Brennstoffen abh√§ngig sind, k√∂nnten Klimaschutzma√ünahmen als Bedrohung f√ºr ihre Gewinne betrachten. Die Umstellung auf nachhaltigere Praktiken erfordert m√∂glicherweise Investitionen und Ver√§nderungen, die sich kurzfristig als kostenintensiv darstellen.
2. **Politische Parteien bzw. Interessen** - In einigen F√§llen k√∂nnten politische Entscheidungstr√§ger, die von Industrieunterst√ºtzung abh√§ngig sind, z√∂gern, Ma√ünahmen zu ergreifen, die bestimmte Wirtschaftssektoren belasten k√∂nnten. Es gibt auch politische Ideologien, die den Umweltschutz als eine geringere Priorit√§t betrachten. Unterschiedliche politische Parteien k√∂nnen unterschiedliche Priorit√§ten und Meinungen in Bezug auf Klimapolitik haben, und es kann zu politischen Auseinandersetzungen √ºber den besten Weg kommen.
3. **Nationalstaaten/Internationale Ebene** - Einige L√§nder k√∂nnten z√∂gern, Klimaschutzma√ünahmen zu ergreifen, aus Sorge, dass dies zu einem wirtschaftlichen Nachteil im internationalen Wettbewerb f√ºhren k√∂nnte, wenn andere L√§nder keine vergleichbaren Ma√ünahmen ergreifen. Oder aufgrund mangelnder internationaler Verpflichtungen oder politischer Ideologien.
4. **Industrie und Unternehmen** - In einigen Branchen, insbesondere solchen, die stark von fossilen Brennstoffen abh√§ngig sind, k√∂nnten Unternehmen versuchen, strenge Umweltauflagen zu blockieren oder zu verz√∂gern, um ihre kurzfristigen Gewinne zu sch√ºtzen.
5. **Automobilindustrie** - Die Umstellung auf emissionsfreie Fahrzeuge erfordert erhebliche Investitionen von Autoherstellern. Diese k√∂nnten sich gegen strenge Umweltauflagen wehren, um ihre Wettbewerbsf√§higkeit zu erhalten.
6. **Landwirtschaft** - Landwirtschaftliche Interessen k√∂nnen Bedenken hinsichtlich m√∂glicher Regulierungen und √Ñnderungen in den landwirtschaftlichen Praktiken haben.
7. **Angst vor wirtschaftlichem Wettbewerbsnachteil** - Einige L√§nder oder Unternehmen k√∂nnten z√∂gern, Klimaschutzma√ünahmen zu ergreifen, aus Angst, dass dies zu einem wirtschaftlichen Nachteil im internationalen Wettbewerb f√ºhren k√∂nnte, wenn andere L√§nder keine vergleichbaren Ma√ünahmen ergreifen.
8. **Mangelnde Aufkl√§rung oder Verst√§ndnis** - Einige Menschen verstehen m√∂glicherweise nicht vollst√§ndig die Dringlichkeit des Klimawandels oder leugnen ihn sogar aufgrund von mangelndem Wissen, falschen Informationen oder ideologischen √úberzeugungen.
9. **Kurzfristige Denkweise** - Einige Entscheidungstr√§ger k√∂nnten sich auf kurzfristige Ziele konzentrieren und Ma√ünahmen zum Klimaschutz vernachl√§ssigen, die langfristige Vorteile bringen.
10. **Lokale Ebene** - In einigen F√§llen k√∂nnten lokale Interessen, wie zum Beispiel in Regionen mit starker Abh√§ngigkeit von fossilen Brennstoffen, gegen Klimaschutzma√ünahmen sein, um wirtschaftliche Ver√§nderungen bzw. Nachteile zu verhindern.
11. **B√ºrgerinitiativen** - Einige B√ºrger k√∂nnten sich gegen bestimmte Klimaschutzma√ünahmen aussprechen, wenn sie deren Auswirkungen auf ihre Lebensqualit√§t oder wirtschaftliche Situation f√ºrchten.
12. **Falsche Informationen und Lobbyarbeit** - Einflussreiche Lobbygruppen k√∂nnten falsche Informationen verbreiten, um die √∂ffentliche Meinung gegen Klimaschutzma√ünahmen zu beeinflussen.
13. **Mangelnde Priorit√§t** - In einigen F√§llen k√∂nnten Entscheidungstr√§ger den Klimawandel als eine geringere Priorit√§t betrachten und daher nicht die notwendigen Ma√ünahmen ergreifen.
14. **Gezielte Falschmeldungen** durch gewisse Akteure, um die Polarisierung in der Gesellschaft voranzutreiben und n√∂tige Gesetze zu erschweren, allgemein mit dem Ziel die Demokratie zu schw√§chen. (Danke @ [Automatic-Cat-5348](https://www.reddit.com/user/Automatic-Cat-5348/)).

Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass dies allgemeine Faktoren sind, und es gibt sicherlich Unterschiede in den Gr√ºnden und Motivationen auf individueller, institutioneller oder nationaler Ebene. Der Klimawandel und seine Bek√§mpfung sind komplexe Herausforderungen, die verschiedene Sektoren der Gesellschaft betreffen, und die Hindernisse f√ºr wirksame Ma√ünahmen k√∂nnen sehr vielf√§ltig sein.

Auf der Internetseite Climateactiontracker.org wird die wahrscheinliche Erw√§rmung bis Ende des Jahrhunderts mit 2,7 Grad Celsius angegeben.

Die Frage: Bezieht sich die Klimasensitivit√§t ausschlie√ülich auf die CO2 Konzentration und nicht auf das √Ñquivalent? Und wenn nicht, wie kommt der Climateactiontracker dann ""nur"" auf 2,7 Grad Celsius Erw√§rmung?

**Das Jahr 2023 war das bisher hei√üeste Jahr seit Beginn der Wetteraufzeichnungen. √Ñnderungen im Wettergeschehen sind markant, weitreichend und treten immer h√§ufiger auf. Anpassungsma√ünahmen und Klimaservices stehen nun im Fokus.**

Neue Erkenntnisse aus der Forschung zum Klimawandel vertiefen unser Wissen beispielsweise zur ver√§nderten Dynamik von Tiefdruckgebieten √ºber dem Nordatlantik, zu den Starkniederschl√§gen mit verheerenden regionalen Auswirkungen oder zu den sich verst√§rkenden Hitzewellen, die eine ernsthafte Gefahr f√ºr die die Gesundheit der Menschen darstellen. Dieses Wissen erm√∂glicht verbesserte Wettervorhersagen und genauere Modellierungen des Klimas der Zukunft als Grundlage f√ºr notwendige Ma√ünahmen zur Klimaanpassung.

Frank B√∂ttcher, Vorsitzender der Deutschen Meteorologischen Gesellschaft:

>""Der Staatengemeinschaft ist es in den letzten 30 Jahren nicht gelungen, die Treibhausgaskonzentrationen zu senken oder auch nur den Anstieg zu stoppen. Wir sind jetzt in eine Phase eingetreten, in der das Klimasystem sich mit sehr viel mehr Dynamik ver√§ndert als bisher. Die √úberschreitung der 1.5¬∞C Grenze aus dem Pariser Abkommen ist in wenigen Jahren zu erwarten. Das erste Drittel dieser Erw√§rmung erfolgte in etwa 80 Jahren, das zweite Drittel in etwa 23 Jahren; f√ºr das letzte Drittel erwarten wir eine Zeitspanne von nur 12 Jahren. Vor diesem Hintergrund m√ºssen wir uns in den n√§chsten Jahrzehnten, auf ganz erhebliche Ver√§nderungen des Klimasystems einstellen.""

**100 f√ºhrende Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftler beraten sich vom 12. bis 14. M√§rz auf der DKT 13 (der Deutschen Klimatagung) in Potsdam, auf dem Telegrafenberg, zu diesen dringenden und nahezu alle Bereiche des menschlichen Lebens betreffenden Zukunftsfragen.**

**Sturmtiefs k√∂nnen in Europa erhebliche Sch√§den verursachen ‚Äì Modellsimulationen zeigen eine k√ºnftige Ausweitung der Starkwindzonen.**

Es ist wichtig zu verstehen, wie die Klimaerw√§rmung unsere Tiefdruckgebiete beeinflussen wird. Nach Modellsimulationen wird sich die Intensit√§t von Tiefdruckgebieten in der Zukunft wahrscheinlich nicht stark √§ndern. Jedoch k√∂nnten sich die von starken Winden betroffenen Regionen vergr√∂√üern ‚Äì und damit auch deren Schadenspotenzial. Die dieser Tendenz zugrunde liegenden physikalischen Prozesse werden aktuell untersucht.

**Rekordwarmer Nordatlantik ‚Äì Grund zur Sorge? Ursachensuche.**

2023 war das hei√üeste Jahr seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen. Welches sind die Ursachen f√ºr die Rekordtemperaturen der Meeresoberfl√§chen und der bodennahen Atmosph√§re und inwieweit gibt der au√üergew√∂hnlich warme Nordatlantik Anlass zur Sorge? Hat der Ausbruch eines Vulkans damit etwas zu tun oder haben die niedrigeren Aerosolemissionen der globalen Handelsschifffahrt einen Einfluss? Welchen Beitrag leisten gro√ür√§umige Ereignisse wie El Ni√±o? Diese Fragen werden in mehreren Beitr√§gen diskutiert.

**Hitzewellen der letzten Jahrzehnte hatten weltweit enorme gesundheitliche und finanzielle Auswirkungen ‚Äì wird die Zukunft alles noch √ºbertreffen?**

Die Hitzewellen der letzten Jahrzehnte hatten erhebliche Auswirkungen auf die Gesellschaft. M√ºssen wir erwarten, dass zuk√ºnftige Hitzewellen das Bisherige noch weit √ºbertreffen? Gemeinsam mit anderen Organisationen entwickelt der Deutsche Wetterdienst die Grundlagen f√ºr notwendige Ma√ünahmen zur Abmilderung der Folgen von zuk√ºnftigen Hitze- und K√§ltewellen sowie Starkregenereignissen.

**Im Zuge des Klimawandels muss Deutschland auch in Zukunft mit verheerenden Starkregenereignissen rechnen.**

Bundesweit einheitliche Gefahrenkarten sind in Arbeit und werden der gesamten Bev√∂lkerung frei zur Verf√ºgung stehen. Dazu werden mit hochaufgel√∂sten Simulationen m√∂gliche √úberflutungsszenarien erstellt. Dadurch kann das Risikopotential besser eingesch√§tzt werden und Planung und Durchf√ºhrung von Schutzma√ünahmen k√∂nnen unterst√ºtzt werden.

Ein Langzeitversuch in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern quantifiziert die Zeitr√§ume, innerhalb derer durch die Wiedervern√§ssung von Mooren regionale klimatische √Ñnderungen bewirkt werden k√∂nnen und untersucht, welchen Einfluss Extremereignisse, wie beispielsweise der Trockensommer 2018, haben.

**KI in der Klimaforschung.**

Das Potential von Methoden der k√ºnstlichen Intelligenz f√ºr die Klimaforschung wird in diversen Beitr√§gen aufgezeigt. Ein Beispiel ist die Vorhersage des El Ni√±o-Ph√§nomens, welches mit den Temperaturrekorden ab dem Sommer 2023 in Verbindung gebracht wird.

**Hochaufgel√∂ste Klimavorhersagen auf unterschiedlichen Zeitskalen als Basis f√ºr zukunftsweisende Entscheidungen.**

Der Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) ver√∂ffentlicht Vorhersagen f√ºr die n√§chsten Wochen, Monate und Jahre. F√ºr die Erstellung qualit√§tsgepr√ºfter und r√§umlich hoch aufgel√∂ster Datens√§tze werden Nutzer aus unterschiedlichen Sektoren eingebunden, um eine h√∂chstm√∂gliche Verst√§ndlichkeit und Anwendbarkeit f√ºr die Beratung in Klimafragen f√ºr Politik, Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft zu erzielen.

**Ist das normal oder schon der Klimawandel?**

Seitdem der Klimawandel in den √∂ffentlichen Diskurs Einzug gehalten hat, wird im Zusammenhang mit Extremwetterereignissen in Deutschland und der Welt immer wieder dieselbe Frage gestellt. In den letzten zehn Jahren entwickelten Wissenschaftler daher Methoden, um die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels auf einzelne Extremwetterereignisse zu quantifizieren. Ergebnisse dieser Analysen werden in mehreren Beitr√§gen auf der DKT diskutiert.

**Zu der Tagung eingeladen** hat die Deutsche Meteorologische Gesellschaft (DMG), unterst√ºtzt durch das Deutsche Geoforschungszentrum (GFZ), das Alfred-Wegener-Institut Helmholz-Zentrum f√ºr Polar- und Meeresforschung (AWI), das Potsdam-Institut f√ºr Klimafolgenforschung (PIK), die Freie Universit√§t Berlin und den Deutschen Wetterdienst (DWD).

**√ñffentliche Podiumsdiskussion am 12.03.2024 um 20 Uhr, Wissenschaftsetage Potsdam.** Im Rahmen der 13. Deutschen Klimatagung findet am Dienstag, den 12.3.2024 um 20 Uhr in der Wissenschaftsetage Potsdam eine √∂ffentliche Podiumsdiskussion statt. Zum Thema ‚ÄúEin Planet, verschiedene Wahrnehmungen: Klimakrise und Kommunikation‚Äù diskutieren Stefan Rahmstorf (Potsdam-Institut f√ºr Klimafolgenforschung), Sophie Haebel (Klimarat Potsdam), Katharina von Bronswijk (Psychologische Psychotherapeutin), Max B√ºrck-Gemassmer (Allianz Klimawandel und Gesundheit) und Kirsten Lange (Netzwerk Klimajournalismus). Es moderiert Gunther Tiersch vom Fachausschuss Klimakommunikation der Deutschen Meteorologischen Gesellschaft.

1dffg15,Was ist schlimm an dem Klimawandel?,"Hey, lasst uns bitte eine respektvolle diskusion haben ich will niemanden √§rgern sondern habe wirklich ein paar fragen zu dem Klimawandel die mich dazu bringen skeptisch zu sein, dar√ºber das er anthropogen ist.

Helft mir bitte eure denkweise zu verstehen und erkl√§rt mmir ein paar Sachen die ich vielleicht falsch verstanden habe damit ich helfen kann die Menschheit zu retten.

Also meine erste Frage w√§re bez√ºglich den Auswirkungen des Klimawandels auf die menschliche Species und ihr fortbestehen, wie wird der Klimawandel uns beeinfl√ºssen oder schaden?

Laut NASA ist die Erde seit dem Klimawandel gr√ºner geworden, da der h√∂here CO2 Gehalt in der Luft und die h√∂here Tempratur das Pflanzenwachstum unterst√ºtzen.  
[https://www.nasa.gov/technology/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth-study-finds/](https://www.nasa.gov/technology/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth-study-finds/)

Die meisten Waldbrende sind brandstiftung und nicht komplett Klima bedingt.  
[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-shows-84-wildfires-caused-humans-180962315/](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-shows-84-wildfires-caused-humans-180962315/)  
aber nart√ºrlich erkenne ich an dass der Klimawandel die Br√§nde extremer macht, trotzdem muss man beachten das nur die nart√ºrlichen Br√§nde wenig Schaden anrichten und die Erde ingesamt gr√ºner wird trotz 84% der Waldbr√§nde die durch Menschen erzeugt wurden.

Das die W√ºsten teils gr√∂√üer werden, ist auch unwichtig da die Erde insgesamt gr√ºner wird.

Bitte beachtet auch das unsere aktuellen Modelle des Klimas die Wirkung von Wolken (Sonneinstrahlung) und den Meere garnicht darstellen k√∂nnen daher kann man nicht zu 100% sagen dass der Klimawandel komplett durch Menschen verursacht wurde.  
Im Vergleich zum bisherigen Klimawandel der Erde ist das garnichts.

Dann gibt es das Artensterben, aber das ist normal und gab es schon immer. (egal ob der jetzige Klimawandel anthropogen ist oder nicht). Arten passen sich an oder sterben aus so ist die Evolution nun mal.

Das einzige sehr schlimme an dem aktuellen Klimawandel sind die Steigung des Meeresspiegel und die extremeren Wetterereignisse, aber ich bezweifle das wenn wir jetzt komplett aufh√∂ren mit dem CO2 wir noch viel retten werden und wir m√ºssten viele Menschen sterben lassen um mit dem CO2 aufzuh√∂ren aktuell.

Ich wei√ü das es viel zu diskutieren gibt aber ich kann nicht √ºbersehen das in den Medien nur die eine Seite gezeigt wird, es gibt viele Wissenschaftler die nicht an den anthropogenen Klimanwadel zu 100% glauben, aber ihrer Sichtweise wird kein Geh√∂r geschenkt.  
Mann kann ja wenigstens die Fakten nennen und dann erkl√§ren wo der Denkfehler ist stattdessen wird man wie ein Irer behandelt.

mich interessiert es brennend, ob manche von euch den Klimawandel (oder andere Missst√§nde) bei der Jobwahl ber√ºcksichtigt haben.

  
Meine Freunde und ich hatten am Wochenende dar√ºber eine Diskussion.

Einer von uns hatte sogar die Idee, man k√∂nnte sich bei klimaunfreundlichen Unternehmen bewerben, dort die Karriereleiter erklimmen, und dann versuchen in einer F√ºhrungsposition einen klimafreundlicheren Weg einzuschlagen.

Realistisch (oder gar schlau) ist diese Idee nat√ºrlich in den meisten F√§llen eher nicht.

1cxsqst,Umgang mit Klimaleugnern,"Liebe Leute, 

Ich bin Handwerker, Schornsteinfeger und Energieberater, √ºberpr√ºfe bei der regul√§ren Arbeit Heizungsanlage und berate meistens w√§hrenddessen die verunsicherten Kunden, was den das Sinnigste f√ºr ihr Haus sei, sollte die Heizung mal den Geist aufgeben. 

Meistens lauter meine Antwort ""W√§rmepumpe"". 

Nun zur Situation:
Gestern hatte ich eine Kundin mit einem relativ modernen Haus (bj 2000) sie fragte mich ebenfalls, was denn mmn das beste w√§re und ich meinte halt, dass Gas in de heutigen Zeit bei ihrem Haus √ºberhaupt keinen Sinn mehr machen w√ºrde, dass der Gesetzgeber ganz klar weg von Fossilien Brennstoffen will und das im Bezug auf Umwelt, Klima und Zukunft unabdingbar ist, davon weg zu kommen.

Sie begegnete mir mit:

""Ach Sie sind so einer?"" 
Erkl√§rte mir gro√ü, dass es solche Wetter Ver√§nderungen immer gab und das das alles Gehirnw√§sche sei, ihr Heizungsmonteur w√ºrde auch nichts von W√§rmepumpen halten und sie w√ºrde sich auch wieder eine neue Gasheizung einbauen lassen, sie w√ºrde auch auf keinen Fall so eine ratternde Kiste ans Haus stellen. 

Ich meine, seit 1994 ist nachgewiesen, dass der Klimawandel Menschgemacht ist und daf√ºr gibt es wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse... 



Aber wie begegnet man so jemandem? 
Ich habe wenig Lust dem Kunden immer nur zu sagen was er h√∂ren will und ja und amen ist hier der falsche Weg.

Habt ihr Vorschl√§ge oder Ideen?


Edit:
Erstmal vielen Dank f√ºr die vielen Anregungen, Tipps und Antworten.

Als Berater habe ich die T√§tigkeit die Leute zu beraten, sie aufzukl√§ren was ihre Optionen sind und das unabh√§ngig. Bei einer Beratung tue ich das auch, jedoch bei diesen Vorfall war es ein ganz normales Gespr√§ch mit der Kundin w√§hrend meiner T√§tigkeit als Schornsteinfeger, wie es immer wieder vorkommt und nicht als Berater(ich bin mir sicher Sie wei√ü nichts von meiner T√§tigkeit als Energieberater und das will ich auch nicht jedem unter die Nase reiben).

Edit:
""Ich meine, seit 1994 ist nachgewiesen, dass der Klimawandel Menschgemacht ist und daf√ºr gibt es wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse... ""
War keine Aussage von mir gegen√ºber dem Kunde!

Und ich habe ihr keinen Vortrag gehalten, sondern wir haben uns lediglich dar√ºber unterhalten was f√ºr eine Heiztechnik mMn in ihrem Haus am sinnigsten sei, sollte ihre Anlage mal getauscht werden m√ºssen. In einem Nebensatz erw√§hnte ich dann, dass wir fr√ºher oder sp√§ter sowieso von den fossilen Brennstoffen weg m√ºssen, darauf kam dann ihr Spruch der mich zum gr√ºnen gemacht hat üòÉ

1cxe5ym,Vorbildliches Hotel aus Erlangen,"Ich m√∂chte mal wieder eines dieser Vorbilder mit euch teilen, die finde ich wichtig sind als Beispiele wenn mal wieder jemand sagt ‚ÄûX geht nicht weil Y‚Äú

Das Hotel Luise aus Erlangen ist seit 2015 ‚Äûklimapositiv‚Äú also sie kompensieren mehr CO‚ÇÇ als sie nach scope 3 Berechnung emittieren. Das an sich ist erstmal nichts besonderes mehr (und auch generell mit Vorsicht zu genie√üen, wie sicher die meisten von euch inzwischen (wie ich auch*) gelernt haben ‚Äì *man w√ºnschte ich dass das nicht so shade ist, wie es geworden ist. 

Was das Hotel f√ºr mich besonders macht ist die Konsequenz in der sie nachhaltige Ma√ünahmen umsetzen. 

- sie haben mehrere ‚Äûnachwachsende Hotelzimmer‚Äú, also Hotelzimmer die voll cradle to cradle zertifiziert sind (das finde ich richtig krass) 
- Tische aus alten K√ºhlschr√§nken
- Tassen aus Kaffeesatz 
- einen Baum Auf dem Dach als Symbol dass die Natur an oberster Stelle steht
- in jedem Zimmer liegt eine Ausgabe von ‚ÄûKleine Gase ‚Äì gro√üe Wirkung‚Äú
- zero waste Fr√ºhst√ºck (auch krass finde ich f√ºr ein Hotel)
- kfw 45 Standard 
- pv usw ist eh klar

Und das sind nur einige Beispiele von ihren √ºber 230 Ma√ünahmen. 

Wie gesagt mir ist wichtig das zu teilen, weil es zeigt dass sowas geht. Au√üerdem finde ich gibt es mut und n√∂tigen Optimismus in einer Zeit in der es so leicht ist zynisch und handlungsf√§hig zu werden.

Ich bin gespannt was ihr dazu sagt. ",15,5,2024-05-21 13:56:38,de

Nach vielem Hin und Her haben wir eine ""tolle"" Metapher f√ºr unseren Umgang mit dem Klimawandel gefunden:

Wir behandeln den Klimawandel so, wie wir auch √∂ffentliche Toiletten (bzw. in Restaurants etc) behandeln.

Sie m√ºssen recycled, upcycled o√§ werden. Entsteht tats√§chlich M√ºll, habe ich den schlechtesten Weg gefunden. Sehe ich M√ºll in √ñffis o√§. r√§ume ich ihn weg.

Ich versuche halt einfach, meinen Dreck und einen Teil des Vorbenutztenden wegzumachen.

1cn79td,"Untragbare Kosten f√ºr Versicherungen und Staat durch Bau in deutschen Flutgebieten. (Berlin.Table, 6. Mai 2024)","# Der Streit um Sch√§den, die nicht mehr zu bezahlen sind

**Extremwettereignisse und Schadensdimensionen nehmen dramatisch zu. Nun r√§cht sich: Das Bauen in Flutgebieten ist bis heute Alltag. Politik und Verwaltungen haben viel zu viel zugelassen. Nun will niemand mehr die Kosten √ºbernehmen.**

Es war eine unscheinbare Abstimmung bei der letzten Bundesratssitzung vor Ostern. Tagesordnungspunkt 11, keine Aussprache, keine Gegenstimmen, und ruckzuck war das Zweite Gesetz zur √Ñnderung des DWD-Gesetzes abgehakt. Nun darf sich der Deutsche Wetterdienst in Offenbach an die Arbeit machen und ein Naturgefahrenkataster erstellen. Ein Portal, transparent, kostenfrei und f√ºr jeden einsehbar, in dem jeder und jede sein pers√∂nliches Risiko bemessen kann, nach einem Stark- oder Dauerregen den Keller geflutet zu bekommen oder von j√§hen Hagelschl√§gen ereilt zu werden. 

Bislang war dem Wetterdienst ein solches kostenloses Kataster ‚Äì wegen privater Konkurrenz ‚Äì nicht gestattet. Aber es ist √ºberf√§llig, darin sind sich alle einig. Und einig ist sich die Fachwelt auch, dass die Zahl der Extremwetterereignisse mit nachfolgenden Milliardensch√§den h√∂chstwahrscheinlich zunehmen wird. Dann ist es aber auch schon vorbei mit dem Konsens. Vor allem, ob es eine Pflichtversicherung gegen Naturgefahren geben soll, ist umstritten. Seit Jahren w√§hrt inzwischen der Streit. Denn nur rund die H√§lfte der Geb√§ude in Deutschland ist gegen Elementarsch√§den versichert, in einer Reihe von Bundesl√§ndern ist es sogar nur ein Drittel. 

Ja, eine Pflichtversicherung muss her, sagen die 16 Ministerpr√§sidenten der L√§nder. Ja, befand zuletzt auch die SPD-Bundestagsfraktion. Nein, sagt der FDP-Bundesjustizminister und sperrt sich bisher hartn√§ckig dagegen. Nein, sagt auch der Gesamtverband der Versicherer (GDV), der st√§ndig h√∂here Schadensummen begleichen muss. 

Die Versicherer warnen schon lange

Die Assekuranzen sind quasi die Fr√ºhsensoren f√ºr die Elementargefahren. Schon vor 30 Jahren warnten R√ºckversicherer wie die M√ºnchner R√ºck oder Swiss Re eindringlich vor dem Klimawandel und der damit verbundenen mutma√ülichen Schadensh√§ufung. Die Mahner sollten Recht behalten. Dass die Temperaturen in Mitteleuropa schneller steigen als anderswo auf der Welt, kommt erschwerend hinzu.

Die Versicherer kalkulierten bisher in etwa so, dass sie ein 200-j√§hriges Gro√üschadensereignis noch begleichen k√∂nnen. Nur, ein Ereignis wie im Ahrtal findet l√§ngst nicht mehr alle 200 Jahre statt, sondern viel h√§ufiger. Rund 40 Milliarden an materiellen Sch√§den hinterlie√ü die Flut, die sich im Juli 2021 durchs Ahrtal w√§lzte. ‚ÄûNochmal ein solches Ereignis, dann explodieren die Pr√§mien‚Äú, hei√üt es bei den Assekuranzen unter der Hand. Und noch ein bisschen ged√§mpfter: ‚ÄûWir kriegen es nicht mehr gestemmt.‚Äú

Im Klartext: In Deutschland ist angekommen, was sich f√ºr Experten l√§ngst abgezeichnet hat. Der Klimawandel f√ºhrt zu Extremwetterereignissen, die selbst in einem Land wie Deutschland nicht mehr bezahlbar sind. Nicht f√ºr die Versicherer und auch nicht f√ºr die √∂ffentliche Hand. Es sei denn, unter der Einforderung von Pr√§mien, die der gemeine Eigenheimbesitzer nicht mehr bezahlen kann und will. So schieben sich Versicherer und politische Entscheider nun gegenseitig den schwarzen Peter zu.

Es hat sich eine Kultur der Sorglosigkeit eingeschlichen

Doch die Vers√§umnisse sind gemacht ‚Äì und sie sind nicht den Versicherern anzulasten. Vielmehr hat sich eine Kultur der Sorglosigkeit eingeschlichen. Und der freiwilligen Kosten√ºbernahme durch die √∂ffentliche Hand. Immer schon waren insbesondere die St√§dte durch Naturgefahren bedroht. Etwa durch Br√§nde. Die Folge waren strengere Bauvorschriften, Fluchtwege, Sprinkleranlagen, Rauchmelder. Heute haben diese Ereignisse keine Konsequenzen mehr. Jedenfalls nicht diejenigen Ereignisse, die mit Starkregen und √úberschwemmungen zu tun haben. ‚ÄûDie Vorschriften entsprechen nicht mehr den Gegebenheiten‚Äú, klagen Versicherungsfachleute.

√úber 320.000 Geb√§ude in Deutschland stehen in amtlich ausgewiesenen √úberschwemmungsgebieten. Und j√§hrlich kommen immer noch weitere hinzu. √úber 30.000 Geb√§ude in den vergangenen zehn Jahren, wie unl√§ngst der Pr√§sident des Gesamtversicherungsverbandes (GDV), Norbert Rollinger, beklagte. Denn auch heute noch gibt es Baugenehmigungen en masse f√ºr Baupl√§tze auf flutbedrohten Fl√§chen. Weil Gemeinden so gro√üz√ºgig wie leichtfertig Baufl√§chen ausweisen, auch in Flutgebieten, weil das Baurecht zahllose Ausnahmen kennt ‚Äì und weil Landes- und Bundesregierungen im Schadensfall Betroffenen leichtfertig Entsch√§digungen zusagen. Inzwischen wird der Ton schriller. ‚ÄûWir sollen das Problem l√∂sen, das die L√§nder verbockt haben‚Äú, klagt ein Versicherungsexperte.  

√úberhaupt die L√§nder. Im vergangenen Jahr verhinderten sie im Klimaanpassungsgesetz ein sogenanntes Verschlechterungsverbot. Der Vorschlag des Bundes hatte vorgesehen, ‚Äûdie Vulnerabilit√§t von Grundst√ºcken und Bauwerken sowie der betroffenen Gebiete insgesamt gegen√ºber den negativen Folgen des Klimawandels nur insoweit erh√∂hen, als dies unvermeidlich ist‚Äú. Es w√§re eine deutliche Beschr√§nkung von Bauten auf √úberschwemmungsfl√§chen gewesen. In der ver√∂ffentlichten Fassung des Gesetzes ist der Passus komplett gestrichen. Auch im sonst so akkurat administrierten Bayern werden immer noch H√∂fe auf Polderfl√§chen errichtet. 

‚ÄûIhr k√∂nnt doch nicht das Ahrtal entv√∂lkern‚Äú

Wie man es nicht machen sollte, ist im Ahrtal zu besichtigen. Dort flie√üen staatliche Zahlungen nur, wenn die Geb√§ude an gleicher Stelle wieder errichtet werden ‚Äì gerne auf √úberschwemmungsfl√§chen. Eine Verwaltungsvorschrift vom Oktober 2021, erlassen zweieinhalb Monate nach der Flut, legt fest, dass es staatliche Hilfen nur gibt, wenn genau wie vor der Flut wieder aufgebaut wird, im gleichen Umfang, an gleicher Stelle. Zus√§tzliche Schutzma√ünahmen sind nicht eingeplant und werden auch nicht bezuschusst.

Seit der Flut wurde so bis auf zwei Dutzend Geb√§ude in den betroffenen Orten alles wieder so errichtet, wie es einmal stand. Schlimmer noch, auch neue Geb√§ude sind auf den gefluteten Fl√§chen entstanden. Wie etwa gegen√ºber der Don-Bosco-Schule an der St. Pius-Br√ºcke in Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler. Das gesamte Schulzentrum, seinerzeit schwer verw√ºstet, ist bis heute nicht nutzbar. Direkt gegen√ºber am anderen Ufer der Ahr steht auf gleicher H√∂he inzwischen ein schmucker Neubau ‚Äì zynisch formuliert, bereit f√ºr die n√§chste Flut und mit einiger Sicherheit zum Verdruss der Versicherer.

Und die n√§chste Flut wird kommen. Denn vergleichbare Wassermengen hatten schon im Jahr 1910 das Tal geflutet und √§hnliche Verw√ºstungen wie vor drei Jahren hinterlassen. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit ist also hoch, dass 2021 nicht das letzte Mal war. Als Vertreter der Assekuranzen auf den mutma√ülichen Unsinn der Nach- und Neubauten hinwiesen, bekamen sie von den √Ñmtern und aus der Landeshauptstadt zu h√∂ren: ‚ÄûIhr k√∂nnt doch nicht das Tal entv√∂lkern.‚Äú

Der generelle Vorwurf der Versicherer: ‚ÄûDie Landesregierungen sind nicht in der Lage, den W√§hlern die Wahrheit zu sagen.‚Äú Und man muss wohl anf√ºgen: Sie wollen es h√§ufig auch nicht. Die Versicherer ihrerseits sind nicht mehr in der Lage, die Sch√§den zu stemmen. Auch eine Pflichtversicherung, so argumentieren sie, werde nicht funktionieren.

Katastrophen auf Wiedervorlage

Stattdessen fordern sie Korrekturen in den Bauordnungen. ‚ÄûUnseren Bauvorschriften sind Klimawandel und Extremwetterereignisse weitgehend fremd‚Äú, sagt etwa Oliver Hauner, Leiter Sach- und Technische Versicherungen beim GDV. Vordringlich sollte dort ein Schutzziel verankert werden. Ohne ein ausformuliertes Schutzziel bleibe das klimaangepasste Planen und Bauen ein frommer Wunsch. Die These der Versicherer: ‚ÄûDas erzeugt Katastrophen auf Wiedervorlage.‚Äú Eine weitere Forderung: F√ºr jedes neue Bauvorhaben sei vorab und verpflichtend eine Gef√§hrungsbeurteilung f√ºr Extremwetterereignisse vorzulegen.

Die Versicherer haben l√§ngst reagiert. Um ihr Risiko einigerma√üen bemessen zu k√∂nnen, haben sie sich ein Zonierungssystem f√ºr √úberschwemmungssch√§den zugelegt, Z√úRS genannt. 22 Millionen Adressen in Deutschland sind dort, unterteilt in vier Gef√§hrdungsklassen, erfasst. Auch f√ºr Starkregen und potenzielle nachfolgende Sch√§den wurde inzwischen ein (dreistufiges) System eingerichtet. Es hilft den Versicherern bei der Frage, welches Geb√§ude in welchem Ausma√ü hochwassergef√§hrdet ist und wie die Pr√§mien zu kalkulieren sind. 

Und so blieben die Versicherer auch entspannt, als im vergangenen Dezember Niedersachsen und Teile von Sachsen-Anhalt gro√üfl√§chig unter Wasser standen. √úberrascht waren sie nicht. Es waren durchweg Fl√§chen, die in Z√úRS als Zone 3 oder 4 kategorisiert waren, also Riskogebiete. Das System ist so pr√§zise, dass auch Kommunen gerne auf die Daten zur√ºckgreifen w√ºrden. 

Andere sind l√§ngst weiter. In √ñsterreich gibt es ein solches Portal, das im Netz und f√ºr jedermann zug√§nglich in 3-D-Animationen Gefahrenzonen f√ºr Fl√ºsse, Wildb√§che, m√∂gliche Lawinen, Erdbeben, aber auch St√ºrme, Hagel und schwere Schneef√§lle ausweist. Pr√§zise, differenziert nach Wassermengen und Windst√§rken ‚Äì und geb√§udegenau. Die Bewohner wissen, wo sie bei Starkregen die Sands√§cke aufschichten m√ºssen, welche Stra√üen noch befahrbar sind und wo Schutzmauern errichtet werden m√ºssen. Versicherer, Kommunen, Wetterdienste, Ministerien ‚Äì alle haben ihr Wissen eingespeist. Auch die Schweiz hat l√§ngst ein solches Portal, sauber differenziert unter anderem f√ºr Starkregen. Lawinen, Waldbr√§nde, Erdbeben oder auch St√ºrme. Nebenbei haben die ersten Kantone bereits mit Umsiedlungen begonnen, weil das Wohnen an manchen Alpenh√§ngen als zu risikobehaftet gilt.. 

Auch f√ºr Deutschland liegen die Daten vor; aber bisher nicht aggregiert, nicht interpretiert, aufbereitet und auf einem Portal abrufbar. Das soll nun, legitimiert durch das neue Gesetze, in Hochgeschwindigkeit und bis zum Jahresende der Deutsche Wetterdienst erstellen. Die Daten seien vorhanden, sagt Sprecher Uwe Kirsche. Allein, ‚Äûsie sind verstreut √ºbers Land‚Äú. Auch er sagt zum Ahrtal: ‚ÄûEs ist ziemlicher Unsinn, dort wieder aufzubauen, wo die H√§user gerade weggesp√ºlt worden sind.‚Äú Denn die Zahl der Wetterextreme und ihre Intensit√§t w√ºrden zunehmen. Kirsches Fazit: ‚ÄûEs gibt einfach Gebiete, da sollte man nicht wohnen.‚Äú

Letztlich m√ºssen Landesregierungen, Landr√§te und Kommunalverwaltungen den Wildwuchs stoppen. ‚ÄûDie Politik muss jetzt die Weichen stellen und aktiv Klimafolgenanpassung betreiben"", sagt Anja K√§fer-Rohrbach, stellvertretende GDV-Hauptgesch√§ftsf√ºhrerin. Doch die politischen Entscheider z√∂gern. Die einen, weil sie immer noch Bebauungsgebiete ausweisen wollen, die anderen, weil sie die Kosten und ein Risikokataster f√ºrchten. Der Grund: F√ºr Siedlungsfl√§chen, die amtlich als flutgef√§hrdet ausgewiesen sind, verlieren die darauf stehenden Immobilien augenblicklich dramatisch an Wert. F√ºr die Hauseigent√ºmer, f√ºr Immobilienfonds, f√ºr die Kommunen. Es gibt keine Gewinner, nur Verlierer ‚Äì und ganz viel schlechte Stimmung. 

Auch die SPD-Bundestagsfraktion will ‚Äì anders als die Versicherer ‚Äì eine Pflichtversicherung f√ºr Immobilienbesitzer. Aber auch Johannes Fechner, SPD-MdB und einer der Autoren des SPD-Papiers, bekennt: ‚ÄûIn Sachen Pr√§vention m√ºssen wir viel h√§rter durchgreifen.‚Äú Und ja, dazu bed√ºrfe es ‚Äûpolitischer H√§rte‚Äú.

1cecshu,"Ehrliche Meinung: Ich denke nicht, dass wir den Klimawandel noch aufhalten k√∂nnen und er ist bei weitem nicht das einzige existentielle Problem welches wir haben","Der Titel spricht eigentlich f√ºr sich. Ich denke nicht, dass wir nur ansatzweise noch etwas gegen den Klimawandel unternehmen k√∂nnen und das Jahr 2023 und das bisherige Jahr 2024 haben es mehr als deutlich gemacht. 

Es sind mehrere Faktoren, die Zeigen wie verzwickt die Lage eigentlich ist:

 Erstens sollten wir jetzt eigentlich in eine La Nina Phase wechseln, jedoch liegen Temperaturen trotzdem noch √ºber der 2016er El Nino Phase und noch √ºber der 2023er El Nino Phase. Auch beachten sollte man, dass der Effekt von CO¬≤ in der Atmosph√§re erst zeitverz√∂gert zur Wirkung kommt und wir in den letzten Jahren unseren CO¬≤ nur noch erh√∂ht haben. Auch haben wir 2023 das erste mal durchschnittlich 1,5¬∞C erreicht, was wir eigentlich um alles verhindern wollten und das bis 2100, **77** Jahre fr√ºher als erwartet.

Des weiteren haben wir einige Kippunkte identifiziert und sind auch kurz davor einige zu √ºberschreiten. Die Atlantische Umw√§lzstr√∂mung (AMOC) ist so schwach wie lange nicht mehr; wir haben erst letztens festgestellt, dass Gr√∂nland 20% mehr Eis verliert, als wir dachten; die jetzige Korallenbleiche ist die schlimmste die von uns beobachtet wurde, was die Zerst√∂rung eines kompletten √ñkosystems bedeutet; der Permafrost gibt mehr CO¬≤ ab, als er aufnimmt und das sind nur einige Faktoren.

Die Ozeane stehen im allgemeinen kein bisschen besser da und die aktuelle Entwicklung ist sogar fast noch erschreckender. Ozeantemperaturen sind auf einem Rekordhoch, was u.a. dazu f√ºhrt, dass Fische teilweise in Richtung der Pole wandern, um der Hitze zu entkommen. Hierzu kommt, dass die Mehrheit aller Fischarten bereits jetzt √ºberfischt sind, 97% der in der Bonner Konvention festgehaltenen wandernden Fischarten sind kurz vor dem Aussterben (sowie 1/5 aller dort gelisteten Arten), w√§hrend 10% aller Meereslebewesen bereits jetzt schon kurz vor dem Aussterben sind, eine Zahl die auf 90% steigen k√∂nnte sollten wir unsere Emissionen nicht reduzieren.

Klar k√∂nnte man jetzt noch unz√§hlige andere Umweltprobleme, als auch gesellschaftliche Probleme aufz√§hlen, die durch all das ausgel√∂st werden bzw. schon in vollem Gange sind, aber das w√ºrde den Rahmen sprengen und eigentlich sollte das auch reichen. Wenn man jetzt bedenkt, dass keines dieser Probleme nur ansatzweise Anklang findet und es auch keine internationale Zusammenarbeit gibt, um diese globalen Probleme zu l√∂sen und auch keine Bem√ºhungen stattfinden CO¬≤ Emissionen **weltweit** zu reduzieren, kann man sich eigentlich selbst ausmalen, zu was das f√ºhren wird.

1c8hddl,Mehr CO2 in der Marsatmosph√§re und dennoch weniger Treibhauseffekt?,"Liebe Lesende,
k√ºrzlich kam die Frage auf, wieso auf dem Mars ein geringerer Treibhauseffekt als auf der Erde herrscht, obwohl es eine bedeutemd gr√∂√üere CO2-Konzentration gibt. Nun ja, die Antwort ist nicht ganz einfach, aber vorweg: beim Treibhauseffekt geht es nicht einfach um die Konzentration eines Gases in einem bestimmten Raum.

Die Atmosph√§re des Mars ist sehr d√ºnn, woraus folgt, dass CO2 zwar Infrarot-Strahlung in thermische Energie umwandeln kann, aber nicht genug zum Erhitzen da ist. Schauen wir uns einige Hintergrundinformationen zum Treibhauseffekt an: wenn ein Planet keine Atmosph√§re hat, k√∂nnen wir die Temperatur seiner Oberfl√§che leicht berechnen, basierend auf der Energiemenge, die die Sonne produziert, der Entfernung des Planeten von der Sonne und der Lichtmenge, die der Planet reflektiert. Das bezeichnen wir in der Meteorologie als Effektivtemperatur.

Um herauszufinden, wie hoch die Temperatur eines Planeten mit Atmosph√§re ist, m√ºssen wir dar√ºber nachdenken, wie viel Sonnenstrahlung durch die Atmosph√§re absorbiert wird und wie viel Strahlung, die von der Planetenoberfl√§che ausgeht, von der Atmosph√§re absorbiert wird, bevor sie dort ankommt. Der Treibhauseffekt entsteht, wenn ein Teil der von der Oberfl√§che eines Planeten nach oben abgestrahlten Energie absorbiert und in W√§rme umgewandelt wird, bevor er in den Weltraum gelangt.

Die Sonne strahlt Licht mit vielen Frequenzen aus, aber die meiste Energie liegt im sichtbaren Teil des Spektrums, den wir mit unseren Augen sehen k√∂nnen. Auf der Erde wird UV-Strahlung vom Ozon in der Stratosph√§re absorbiert, was die mittlere Atmosph√§re erw√§rmt, aber die Erdatmosph√§re ist f√ºr sichtbares Licht fast vollst√§ndig transparent. Der Boden absorbiert jedoch einen Teil dieses Lichts, erw√§rmt sich und strahlt Energie in Wellenl√§ngen ab, die auf der Oberfl√§chentemperatur basieren, wobei es sich bei terrestrischen Temperaturen haupts√§chlich um Infrarotstrahlung handelt.

Die Mathematik dahinter ist kompliziert, aber die Quintessenz ist: Strahlung, die von der Sonne kommt oder von dem Planeten aufsteigt, wird absorbiert und die Atmosph√§re erw√§rmt.

Die Marsoberfl√§che ist (im Vergleich zur Erde) aus folgenden Faktoren kalt:

1. Die Marsatmosph√§re ist besonders: es gibt nicht viel von ihr. Die Luftdichte auf der Erde betr√§gt ungef√§hr 1,23 kg/m¬≥. Die Luftdichte des Mars betr√§gt hochgerechnet 0,015 kg/m¬≥ ‚Üí weniger als 1,5 % des Durchschnitts der Erde. Zwischen der Marsoberfl√§che und dem Weltraum gibt es also bedeutend weniger Atmosph√§re als zwischen Erdoberfl√§che und Weltraum. Folgerichtig k√∂nnen wir also sagen, dass es durch die geringe Luftdichte sehr unwahrscheinlich ist, dass ein Photon auf seinem Weg durch die Atmosph√§re absorbiert wird.

2. Der Mars ist weiter von der Sonne entfernt als die Erde. Der Mars umkreist die Sonne in einer mehr als 1,5-fachen Entfernung wie die Erde und erh√§lt daher nur etwa 43 % der Energie der Erde (586 W/m¬≤ f√ºr den Mars gegen√ºber 1361 W/m¬≤ f√ºr die Erde).",31,33,2024-04-20 00:39:29,de

1c59wlp,Ich kann meine Position nicht untermauern und brauche Hilfe,"Hallo Community,


gestern haben ein paar Freunde √ºber den Klimawandel diskutiert und ich war unf√§hig, meine Position richtig dar zu stellen.... Ich habe meine Meinung von reddit, habe aber gemerkt, dass ich sie nicht richtig mit Fakten unterst√ºtzen konnte, sondern da eher auf Gef√ºhl laufe. Ich m√∂chte hier mal die Position meiner Freunde darstellen

1. Klimawandel ist ein globales Problem. Was bringt es uns als einzige Nation den Klimawandel anzugehen? Sowas muss international gel√∂st werden, es ist ja auch ein globales Problem, also braucht es eine globale L√∂sung. 


2. Warum soll Deutschland den Held spielen und versuchen, den Klimawandel vor allen anderen mit zu l√∂sen, wenn uns die Auswirkungen nicht so stark treffen werden?


3. Es hat keinerlei finanzielle Vor- aber alle Nachteile, wenn wir unsere Wirtschaft teuer anpassen, ohne jetzt einen Gegenwert zu haben. Denn die anderen L√§nder passen ihre Wirtschaft nicht an und wir werden zur√ºck gelassen, weil wir unsere Wirtschaft mit Investition in Klimama√ünahmen zerst√∂ren. 


Sie meinten auch, sie ""stehen ja ethisch hinter dir, aber finanziell ist das halt nichts"" und nachdem ich gefragt wurde ""warum soll denn grade Deutschland in Klimawandelma√ünahmen investieren?"" konnte ich nichts mehr sagen. 


Meine Position ist, da√ü Klimawandelma√ünahmen sich rechnen werden (aber wie und warum?) und das wir schnellstm√∂glich was tun m√ºssen, das Klimawandel nicht teuer sein muss und es viele L√∂sungen gibt. Das Argument, das wir Menschenleben retten, wird nicht gez√§hlt, da es ethisch ist.

Mein Kumpel meinte dann, wenn ich so sehr hinter Wissenschaft und Fakten bin und es ja angeblich so leicht und auch billig sein kann, den Klimawandel zu stoppen, warum macht es dann niemand? Das kann ja nur sein, weil es so nunmal so teuer und unpopul√§r ist. 


Kann mir jemand helfen, Quellen zu suchen, die meine Meinung st√ºtzen? Viel zu lange hab ich nur gelesen und gesagt Jo muss stimmen und jetzt hatte ich nichts zu sagen... Mein Kumpel meinte noch, wenn die Argumente so auf der Hand liegen, m√ºsste ich das doch auch einfach so k√∂nnen ohne dar√ºber nach zu denken und das hat mich komplett raus gebracht, weil ich eigentlich auch so denke. 


Vielen Dank an alle die das hier gelesen haben und ich hoffe, ich bekomme ein paar Antworten und Quellen :D ich habe google bereits bem√ºht aber finde nicht wirklich was zu diesen spezifsichen Fragen.",52,293,2024-04-16 03:13:10,de

Unsere Politik wirft uns aber ein paar Schmerzmittel hin. Keiner will die unangenehme Wahrheit √ºberbringen oder sogar handeln. Somit verrecken wir langsam, aber wenigstens angenehm unter Schmerzmittel - bis dann irgendwann noch offensichtlicher wird, dass man wohl besser schon fr√ºher was gemacht h√§tte.

Hoffnungslos weil immer wieder auf Eigenverantwortungsbasis der ""B√ºrger"" gepocht wird. √úberraschung - Eigenverantwortung klappt nicht. Wir fressen ungesunden Scheiss, trinken massiv zu viel Alkohol, rauchen und schaffen es nicht mal 2x pro Woche 30min zum Sport. (nat√ºrlich nicht alle, aber das Problem ist ja genau auf Gesamtgesellschaftlicher Stufe) - Konsequenzen, die wir tragen. Und zwar alleine. Das ist den meisten klar. Wir alleine sind benachteiligt durch diesen Lebensstil. Trotzdem schaffen wir es nicht, uns zu √§ndern. Und dann sollen wir es schaffen, zu Gunsten von der Allgemeinheit etwas zu √§ndern?

Die Leute, die am meisten etwas √§ndern m√ºssen sind leider aber gerade die, die davon profitieren wenn alles so bleibt. Zumindest kurzfristig.

Wie geht man damit um? Wie geht ihr damit um?",18,54,2024-02-23 08:46:28,de

1arjg08,Ganz grob und vereinfacht: Ist El Nino das Luft-√§quivalent zum AMOC? Bzw. ist das nicht alles eine Sache?,"Habe nat√ºrlich Suchmaschinen benutzt und Sachen gelesen, aber verstehs nicht genug. 

Beim AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) meint man prim√§r das Ph√§nomen von warmen Klima das nach Nordeuropa gelangt, es ist aber eigentlich ein Kreislauf/Meeresstr√∂mung, die sich durch alle Weltmeere √ºber den Globus bewegt.

Bei El Nino (oder El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation, ENSO)  finde ich nur Dinge, wie S√ºdostasien und S√ºdamerika einander beeinflussen, aber das m√ºsste doch auch eine Verkettung einmal um den Globus sein?   
Ich denk da noch an diese Dynamik zwischen Australien und S√ºdafrika, wenns bei den einen brennt, gibts bei den anderen Flut usw., die man IOD (Indian Ocean Dipole) nennt. 

Nach meinem groben Verst√§ndnis (tut mir Leid wegen etwaiger Kopfschmerzen) m√ºsste doch ENSO und IOD eine Sache sein die einander bedingt und wahrscheinlich auch eine Sache mit dem AMOC? So eine Schleife, mit der kalten und warmen Str√∂mung in den Meeren und entsprechend Hoch- und Tiefdruck-Gebieten und Luftstr√∂mungen? 

Wenn das eine Sache w√§re, hat die einen Namen? Oder ist das so grob zusammengefasst, dass es einfach Weltklima ist? haha

In meiner Vorstellung m√ºsste doch eine √Ñnderung in einem dieser Systeme sich auf alle anderen auswirken. Alles was ich aber so im Alltag an Nachrichten oder in Youtube-Dokus wahrnehme, sind die genannten Systeme im Einzelnen. Liegt also nahe, dass das getrennte Dinge sind und ich eine falsche Vorstellung habe okay, aber eventuell ist es ja doch eine gro√üe Sache.

1aqp212,Welche Einschr√§nkungen braucht es?,"Moin zusammen,

Ich habe kaum Ahnung zum Thema Klimawandel. Ich wei√ü er ist da und wird schlimmer. So weit, so basic. Ich kann mich nicht in jedes Fachgebiet auf hohes Niveau einlesen.
Jetzt bin ich in letzter Zeit, im Rahmen der Artikel von Prof. Dr. Stefan Rahmstorf, auf das Kippen des Golfstroms hingewiesen worden. Ich habe von Wissenschaftlichen Papieren zwar nur die H√§lfte verstanden, aber die Dramatik ist klargeworden. Genauso wie die Aussage, die sinnvollerweise an jeden Ende eines Artikels zum Klimawandel steht ""Die Menschen m√ºssen sich einschr√§nken um den Klimawandel zu stoppen!""

Die Frage, die ich mir dann immer stelle ist:"" Wo und Wie muss ich mich einschr√§nken? Also Konkret!"" Ich h√∂re, Fleischkonsum einschr√§nken! Ich Frage mich um wieviel? Ganz oder ist einmal im Monat Ok. Es ist klar Autos sind sch√§dlich! Ich frage mich, wie viel darf ich noch fahren? Darf ich √ºberhaupt fahren?

Das zieht sich so durch. Ich w√ºrde mich gerne mehr f√ºr die Rettung des Klimas einsetzten, verstehe aber nicht so ganz, welche Ver√§nderungen genau das f√ºr mich bedeuten wenn es hei√üt ""Die Menscheit muss sich massiv einschr√§nken!""

Daher jetzt die Frage an euch: Was bedeutet das alles konkret f√ºr mich? Kein Fleisch? Kein Auto? Welche Jobs und Industrien w√ºrde es noch geben? Darf man Reisen oder ist das Exotischste der Nachbarort? Ist das Ehrenamt, wof√ºr man ein Auto braucht noch Unsetzbar oder nicht mehr drin? Wird die Wende im Klimawandel f√ºr mich √ºberhaupt bezahlbar sein? Oder sitze ich dann auf der Stra√üe, weil ich mir die gestiegenen Preise als (aktuell) Unterer Mittelstand nicht mehr leisten kann?

Ich freue/bef√ºrchte eure Antworten. :)",25,34,2024-02-14 10:07:53,de

In meiner Studienzeit habe ich mich viel mit Brennstoffzellen besch√§ftigt und frage mich, warum die Brennstoffzelle nicht mehr im Gespr√§ch ist, wenn es um Umweltschutz geht.  
Es wird dumm gesagt Wasserstoff zu Strom ""gemacht"". Mit den ganzen Windparks im Norden, k√∂nnte man bei Netzauslastung Wasserstoff erzeugen und diesen dann f√ºr Fahrzeuge, Heizung etc verwenden. Das w√ºrde auch den gr√∂ssten Nachteil bei E-Autos, das Lange station√§re Laden an der S√§ule l√∂sen, wenn man an der Tankstelle den Tank mit Wasserstoff volltanken kann. Der Trend geht aber komplett zu ""normalen"" E-Autos mit riesigen Batterien. Ist wahrscheinlich wieder das Henne Ei Problem mit den Tankstellen und die Tatsache, dass die Herstellung von Sauerstoff mehr Energie (Strom) ben√∂tigt als am Ende wieder nach der Umwandlung in der Brennstoffzelle wieder herauskommt. Wenn ich aber sehe dass in der Nordsee Windkraftanlagen still stehen, weil das Netz gerade ausgelastet ist, frage ich mich schon ob das nicht ein Weg w√§re ""kosteng√ºnstig"" Wasserstoff zu machen und zu Nutzen. Wasserstoff kann auch in das Gasnetz eingespeist werden, jedoch kommt es dann beim Endger√§t zu Problemen, da diese dann auf einen Ver√§nderten Brennwert eingestellt werden m√ºssen.

Mit viel Geld beeinflussen ein paar Konzerne die Weltpolitik dahingehend. 

Da kam mir der Gedanke, dass das sehr √§hnlich zu einigen Verschw√∂rungsmythen ist. Da gehts ja oft auch darum, dass es eine kleine, reiche und b√∂se Elite gibt, die die Welt steuert. 

Jetzt w√ºrde ich nicht soweit gehen, dass die fossile Industrie die Welt steuert. Aber dass sie einen gro√üen Einfluss haben, konnte man zuletzt ja auf der COP beobachten. Zudem wurden bekanntlich einige Kriege und Konflikte wegen fossiler Energie gef√ºhrt. 

Daher frage ich mich, wieso das nicht bei Verschw√∂rungsgl√§ubigen so rezipiert wird. Da ist es ja eher das Gegenteil. Man behauptet ja eher eine Linksgr√ºne Elite (wo auch immer die sein soll, man merkt davon bekanntlich wenig) wollte die Welt mit Energiewende und Co irgendwie schlechter machen.

Dennoch erschlie√üt sich mir nicht wirklich der Sinn davon, f√ºr den Klimawandel nur Superreiche verantwortlich zu machen. Klar, Superreiche emitieren pro Person 1000x mehr CO2 als der Durchschnitt. Nur leider interessiert das Klima ja nicht, wer wieviel emittiert, sondern nur, wieviel insgesamt in die Atmosph√§re gelangt. Und wenn jetzt [das reichste 1 Prozent alleine f√ºr 15 Prozent, die √§rmere H√§lfte der Menschheit nur f√ºr 7 Prozent](https://www.oxfam.de/ueber-uns/aktuelles/klimawandel-ungleichheit-reichste-1-prozent-schaedigt-klima-doppelt-so-stark) der Emissionen verantwortlich ist, dann ist das nat√ºrlich wahnsinnig unfair. Doch selbst ohne die Reichen m√ºssten wir immernoch irgendwie die √ºbrigen 85% loswerden!

Es ist schon sinnvoll, auf diese Unterschiede aufmerksam zu machen, nur sehe ich eine Tendenz, zu sagen ""so lange die Reichen viel mehr emitieren als ich, bringt das alles ja nichts."". Nur so lange alle anderen gar nichts ver√§ndern, w√ºrde selbst das komplette Wegfallen aller Reichen den Klimawandel nicht stoppen. Ich sehe da kein ""Entweder-Oder"", sondern beides muss ver√§ndert werden - vor Allem der Konsum der Reichen, aber letztendlich auch der von allen anderen - ausgenommen nat√ºrlich die, die wirklich kaum Geld und damit auch kaum Emissionen haben.",0,85,2023-12-30 12:39:00,de

Meine Kollegin Nina Lakhani, die derzeit in Dubai weilt, hat sich mit der kritischen Frage der Umsetzung befasst, die zu einem echten Knackpunkt in den Gespr√§chen geworden ist.

Sie erkl√§rt:

Wenn es eine Sache gibt, in der sich die Entwicklungsl√§nder in Cop28 einig sind, dann ist es die Forderung an die Industriel√§nder, ihre rechtsverbindlichen Verpflichtungen aus dem Pariser Abkommen einzuhalten und den Entwicklungsl√§ndern die Mittel zur Umsetzung zur Verf√ºgung zu stellen. Dies war das zentrale Thema, das am Montagabend als Reaktion auf den Textentwurf der globalen Bestandsaufnahme immer wieder angesprochen wurde.

Barbara Creecy, die Umweltministerin S√ºdafrikas, sprach √ºber die Erfahrungen ihres Landes bei der Umsetzung einer gerechten Energiewende: ""Wir haben heute weniger als 10 % der Unterst√ºtzung erhalten, die wir bis 2030 f√ºr den Umsetzungsplan ben√∂tigen. F√ºr viele Entwicklungsl√§nder, insbesondere auf dem afrikanischen Kontinent, liegt die L√ºcke nicht im Ehrgeiz, sondern in der Frage der Mittel zur Umsetzung.

Die brasilianische Delegierte f√ºgte hinzu: ""Es ist sehr schwierig, etwas ohne die notwendigen Mittel zu tun. Lassen Sie uns zuerst √ºber die Mittel sprechen. Und auf der Grundlage dieser Mittel werden wir unsere Ambitionen f√ºr Klimagerechtigkeit in Angriff nehmen. Wir haben es geschafft, die Emissionen durch die Rettung der W√§lder zu reduzieren. Wir k√∂nnen nicht allein handeln. Wir brauchen alle, um zu handeln. Die Mittel zur Umsetzung m√ºssen mit unseren Entscheidungen und Zielen in Einklang gebracht werden.""

Was bedeutet also ""Mittel zur Umsetzung"" - und warum ist es so wichtig?

Die Architektur des Pariser Abkommens sieht vor, dass jedes Land einen nationalen Beitrag (Nationally Determined Contribution - NDC) erstellt und umsetzt, der Minderungs- und Anpassungsma√ünahmen UND die Mittel - Finanzierung, Technologietransfer und Kapazit√§tsaufbau - umfasst, mit denen dies umgesetzt werden soll. Die aktuellen NDCs (2021 bis 2030) enthalten l√§nderspezifische Klimaziele und Pl√§ne, die sowohl bedingungslos als auch konditional oder abh√§ngig von internationalen Prozessen sind.

Wie die Industriel√§nder verpflichtet sind, den Tschad, Nepal oder Barbados bei der Erf√ºllung ihrer NDC-Ziele zu unterst√ºtzen, ist in den Artikeln 9, 10 und 11 des Pariser Abkommens geregelt. Artikel 9 besagt, dass die Industriel√§nder Finanzmittel bereitstellen und mobilisieren sollen, w√§hrend andere L√§nder dies freiwillig tun k√∂nnen. In Artikel 10 hei√üt es, dass Entwicklungsl√§nder bei der Entwicklung und dem Transfer von Technologien unterst√ºtzt werden, um ihre Widerstandsf√§higkeit gegen√ºber dem Klimawandel zu verbessern und die Treibhausgasemissionen zu verringern, einschlie√ülich finanzieller Unterst√ºtzung. Artikel 11 befasst sich mit dem Aufbau von Kapazit√§ten in den Entwicklungsl√§ndern, insbesondere in den am wenigsten entwickelten L√§ndern und in den L√§ndern, die am st√§rksten von den negativen Auswirkungen des Klimawandels betroffen sind, wie z. B. kleine Inselstaaten.

Wenn also Bl√∂cke wie die G77 plus China (135 L√§nder) und die gleichgesinnten Entwicklungsl√§nder (LMDC - 20 Nationen) √ºber die Umsetzung des Pariser Abkommens lamentieren, beziehen sie sich oft auf die oben genannten Verpflichtungen, die gr√∂√ütenteils nicht erf√ºllt wurden.

Derzeit ben√∂tigen die Entwicklungsl√§nder laut UNFCCC 5 bis 11 Mrd. US-Dollar f√ºr die Umsetzung der aktuellen NDCs, die 2030 auslaufen - wobei diese riesige Finanzierungsl√ºcke nur 30 % der tats√§chlichen Kosten abdeckt.

Das ist einer der Gr√ºnde, warum die Entwicklungsl√§nder einen Ausstieg aus der Nutzung fossiler Brennstoffe - oder irgendein neues Ziel - ohne Mittel zur Umsetzung einfach nicht akzeptieren k√∂nnen, da sie schon jetzt nicht einmal in der Lage sind, ihre aktuellen Pl√§ne zur Eind√§mmung und Anpassung zu finanzieren (w√§hrend die Kosten f√ºr Verluste und Sch√§den in die H√∂he schnellen).

Nun zur globalen Bestandsaufnahme (GST) - der alle f√ºnf Jahre vorgeschriebenen Bewertung der kollektiven Fortschritte bei den Pariser Verpflichtungen.Das Ergebnis dieser Bestandsaufnahme ist deshalb so wichtig, weil es f√ºr die n√§chste Runde der NDCs, die bis 2025 vorgelegt werden m√ºssen, ma√ügeblich sein wird.

Das wird jetzt etwas langatmig, aber ich m√∂chte noch einen weiteren Artikel anf√ºhren - 9.5 -, der von den Industriel√§ndern verlangt, im Voraus Informationen dar√ºber zu liefern, welche √∂ffentlichen Mittel verf√ºgbar sein werden, um die NDCs der √§rmeren L√§nder zu unterst√ºtzen. Aber das ist einfach nicht geschehen. Und erinnern Sie sich an die 100 Milliarden Dollar pro Jahr f√ºr Klimaschutzma√ünahmen, die bis 2020 mobilisiert werden sollen - eine Zahl, die die USA in Kopenhagen ins Spiel gebracht haben, die aber nie umgesetzt wurde. Nun, diese Zahl wurde mehr oder weniger aus der Luft gegriffen, so dass sich die L√§nder im n√§chsten Jahr auf eine h√∂here, bedarfsgerechte j√§hrliche Finanzierungssumme New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) einigen m√ºssen.Die Industriel√§nder sagen, dass alle bedeutungsvollen Gespr√§che √ºber die Finanzierung bis dahin verschoben werden sollten, w√§hrend die Entwicklungsl√§nder sagen, dass sie Details √ºber die Finanzierung und die Mittel zur Umsetzung in der GST, dem globalen Anpassungsziel und dem gerechten √úbergangsprogramm ben√∂tigen, da sie sonst einfach zum Scheitern verurteilt sind.

Wie Meena Raman vom Third World Network in Malaysia - die unglaublich hilfreich war, um dieses Thema zu verstehen - sagt: ""Ohne Mittel zur Umsetzung sind das alles nur Worte.""",4,4,2023-12-12 09:45:39,de

Eine Recherche im j√ºngsten IPCC-Bericht","In diesem Artikel [https://www.reddit.com/r/Klimawandel/comments/186nkqp/monitoringbericht\_der\_bundesregierung\_erschienen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Klimawandel/comments/186nkqp/monitoringbericht_der_bundesregierung_erschienen/) warf u/intelligent-worker91 die [Frage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Klimawandel/comments/186nkqp/comment/kbd1y3b/) auf, ob sich das Klima in der Vergangenheit nicht st√§rker ver√§ndert hat, als wir √ºblicherweise anerkennen. Er [verwies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Klimawandel/comments/186nkqp/comment/kbe0xme/) dann als Beleg auf den Artikel eines gewissen Dr. Koelle. Ich habe mir das mal angeschaut und habe mal nachgelesen, was der IPCC dazu sagt. Ich dachte, mein Ergebnis ist vielleicht auch f√ºr andere interessant, darum kopiere ich hier mal meinen Kommentar hinein:

&#x200B;

 

Dr.  Koelle, der beim Klimaskeptiker-Verein EIKE aktiv zu sein scheint. Na,  schauen wir mal, was der zu sagen hat... Leider ist bei diesem Artikel  das deutsche Original nicht zu finden. Also muss ich drauf vertrauen,  dass die √úbersetzung so stimmt und auch keine Infos verloren gegangen  sind.

Das ist hier allerdings ein  zentrales Problem bei dieser Quelle: Keine einzige Aussage oder  Abbildung im Text ist mit einer klaren Quelle unterlegt, die man pr√ºfen  k√∂nnte. Bzw. mit der man pr√ºfen k√∂nnte, ob der Autor die Quelle korrekt  wiedergegeben hat. Insbesondere bei Figure 2, auf die Du vermutlich  anspielst, w√ºrde mich eine Quelle interessieren. Dass diese nicht  angegeben ist, muss sehr stutzig machen bei einem Artikel, der  Wissenschaftlichkeit suggeriert.

(Unter  dem Text sind Quellen angegeben, ich wei√ü. Ich m√ºsste die jetzt einzeln  durchgehen um herauszufinden, woher denn Fig. 2 her kommt. So macht man  das in der Wissenschaft aus guten Gr√ºnden nicht, denn viel zu aufw√§ndig  und daher intransparent, siehe die Studien weiter unten mit hunderten  bis tausenden Quellen.)

Von daher  bleibt die Frage nach einem belastbaren Beleg f√ºr Deine Hypothese mit  der warmen Antike offen. Aber ich habe die aufgeworfene Frage mal zum  Anlass genommen, mir das im letzten IPCC-Bericht noch mal n√§her  anzuschauen. Und das ist spannend und es stellt sich heraus, dass es vor  4.000 Jahren offenbar tats√§chlich ziemlich warm war auf der Erde. Das  war aber vor dem r√∂mischen Reich.

Relevant ist hier der 2.500-Seiten starke Bericht der Arbeitsgruppe 1, den Du hier findest: [https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-i/](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-i/).  In Kapitel 2 geht unter anderem um die Rekonstruktion des Klimas der  Vergangenheit. Interessant f√ºr unsere Frage ist Abbildung 2.11 ([https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC\_AR6\_WGI\_Figure\_2\_11.png](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Figure_2_11.png)):

Relevant  ist der obere Bereicht, f√ºr die Zeit des r√∂mischen Reichs insbesondere  der linke (blaue) Bereich. Dargestellt ist ein Bereich der m√∂glichen  Temperatur-Verteilung - die obere und die untere Grenze sowie der  Mittelwert, der f√ºr den AR 6 letztlich verwendet wird. Man sieht hier  verschiedenes interessantes:

1. In der ferneren Vergangenheit (ca. 4000 v.C.) weisen viele Indizien auf eine recht hohe Temperatur hin.
2. Allerdings liegen die Sch√§tzungen f√ºr diese Periode gut 1 Grad auseinander.
3. Der obere Rand der Sch√§tzungen entspricht ungef√§hr der heutigen Temperatur.

Schauen wir uns das genauer an. Die Datenquellen finden sich im ""Supplementary Material"" zum Kapitel 2: [https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC\_AR6\_WGI\_Chapter02\_SM.pdf](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter02_SM.pdf)  Figure 2.11a (a f√ºr den oberen Bereich) ist als Quelle Kaufman et al  (2020a, b) angegeben. Laut Quellenverzeichnis weiter hinten handelt es  sich um diese beiden frei zug√§nglichen Ver√∂ffentlichungen:

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0445-3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0445-3) (30.4.20 erschienen) und [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0530-7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0530-7) (30.6.20)

In  der ersten Publikation beschreiben sie die Datenbank von weltweiten  pal√§oklimatologischen Records (Datenpunkte). Diese umfasst 1.319  Datenpunkte von 679 Orten (jeweils belegt mit einer konkreten  wissenschaftlichen Studie, siehe das Quellenverzeichnis der Publikation  mit mehr als 500 Eintr√§gen). Die Arten der Datenpunkte sind:  ""lake  sediment (51%), marine sediment (31%), peat (11%), glacier ice (3%), and  other natural archives"" - also eine Reihe unterschiedlicher Verfahren  kamen hier zum Einsatz.

In der  zweiten Publikation haben sie diese Daten dann ausgewertet und haben  versucht mit verschiedenen Methoden das Klima der Periode 10.000 v.C.  bis heute (12.000 Jahre) zu rekonstruieren (verschiedene Verfahren >> verschiedene Linien). Man kommt auf einen  Schwankungsbereich, so wie er auch in der AR 6-Figure 2.11 dargestellt  ist. In Figure 3 der Ver√∂ffentlichung ([Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0530-7/figures/3))  wird dann die Sch√§tzung f√ºr die globale Temperatur in ihrer  Schwankungsbreite dargestellt, wie sie dann auch in den AR 6 einfloss:

Das  ist nun die wissenschaftliche Datengrundlage f√ºr den neuesten  IPCC-Bericht AR 6. Alles sauber nachvollziehbar, klare Aussage: Man wei√ü  nicht genau, wie das Klima vor 2.000 oder 4.000 oder 12.000 Jahren war,  aber man kann es mit einem gewissen Schwankungsbereich absch√§tzen (der  f√ºr mich unerwartet  gro√ü ist).

Da  kann man nun schauen, ob die Forscher da Fehler gemacht haben: Haben  sie Daten unzul√§ssig ausgeschlossen? Sind ihre Modelle falsch? Und  nat√ºrlich gibt es auch wissenschaftliche Diskussion darum (verschiedenes  wird im AR 6 vermutlich auch dargestellt), die Wissenschaft entwickelt  sich weiter und im n√§chsten Bericht wird es hier vermutlich ein Update  mit besseren Daten und Methoden geben.

Der  Punkt, bei dem ich hier hinaus will: Die Wissenschaft ist offen f√ºr  Kritik. Diese muss den Stand der Wissenschaft aber anerkennen, sich  damit auseinandersetzen. Und das tut Dr. Dietrich Koelle nicht wirklich,  der Autor des von Dir verlinkten Artikels. Der hat nie selbst in der  Klimawissenschaft geforscht, sich also nie mit den dort angewandten  Methoden besch√§ftigt, kann damit gar nicht wirklich einsch√§tzen, ob die  Methoden sinnvoll sind oder nicht. Stattdessen greift er sich einzelne  Hypothesen heraus und behauptet, diese im Vergleich doch recht  schlichten Hypothesen k√∂nnten das Klima besser erkl√§ren. (Nebenbei  bemerkt sind die Temperaturen seit 2015, als dieser Artikel erschien, ja  deutlich weiter gestiegen. Wie passt das wohl in seine Annahmen?)

Nun  k√∂nnte man sagen: Besch√§ftigt sich die Klimawissenschaft denn mit den  Argumenten der Kritiker? Nat√ºrlich tut sie das! Ob Temperatur- oder  Sonnenstrahlungs-Zyklen usw. die Entwicklung der Temperatur der  Atmosph√§re erkl√§ren k√∂nnen, das l√§sst sich ja pr√ºfen. Teilweise wurde  festgestellt, dass solche Zyklen tats√§chlich relevant sind, siehe bspw.  Abschnitt  2.3.1.4.2, wo beschrieben wird, wie mehrtausendj√§hrige  Orbit-Zyklen sich auf den Monsun auswirken. Das wird in die Klimamodelle  dann aufgenommen. Oder such im WG-1-Bericht mal nach ""Solar Cycle"":  Gibt eine Reihe von Fundstellen, wo beschrieben wird, wo sie tats√§chlich  Relevanz haben. Sollten dort aber neue, starke Erkenntnisse aufkommen,  w√ºrde die Community das sicher (fr√ºher oder sp√§ter) pr√ºfen und ggf. in  Modellen aufgreifen.

So  funktioniert Klimawissenschaft. Es gibt keine  Klimawissenschaftler-Verschw√∂rung. Alle wollen das Klima noch besser  verstehen, damit wir besser wissen, was uns bl√ºht und wie wir vermeiden  k√∂nnen, was uns bl√ºht.",25,2,2023-11-30 08:15:11,de

187iiez,Die wichtigsten Fakten im √úberblick ‚Äì Einblick in die Klimakrise," Hallo r/Klimawandel\-Community!

In diesem Post m√∂chte ich euch einige Schl√ºsselaspekte der Klimakrise n√§herbringen, basierend auf einem aktuellen Artikel des Guardian. Hier sind die wichtigsten Punkte, einfach und verst√§ndlich erkl√§rt:

* **CO‚ÇÇ-Emissionen nach Regionen**: W√§hrend die Emissionen in Europa und Amerika stabilisieren, steigen sie in Asien und Afrika an. Interessant ist, dass, wenn man die Emissionen pro Kopf betrachtet, L√§nder wie die USA und Australien, aber auch Russland und Staaten im Nahen Osten wie Saudi-Arabien und Katar in den Fokus r√ºcken‚Äã.
* **Hauptquellen der Treibhausgase**: Der Energiesektor ist mit 27¬†% der gr√∂√üte Emittent von Treibhausgasen. Der Industriesektor folgt mit 22¬†% und Landwirtschaft, Forstwirtschaft sowie Landnutzungs√§nderungen tragen 20¬†% bei. Interessanterweise hat sich der j√§hrliche Verlust an Baumbest√§nden in den vergangenen zwei Jahrzehnten allm√§hlich erh√∂ht‚Äã.
* **Entwicklung der CO‚ÇÇ-Emissionen**: Seit Beginn der Industrialisierung steigen die CO‚ÇÇ-Emissionen stetig an. Der Planet konnte diese Emissionen zun√§chst in nat√ºrlichen ‚ÄûKohlenstoffsenken‚Äú wie W√§ldern und Ozeanen aufnehmen, aber mit der Zeit wurden mehr Emissionen in der Atmosph√§re gefangen‚Äã.
* **Globale Erw√§rmung**: Die durchschnittliche globale Temperatur ist im Vergleich zum 20. Jahrhundert um 1,2 Grad Celsius gestiegen. Dieser Anstieg hat lokale und monatliche Unterschiede, wie der September 2023, der fast 2 Grad w√§rmer war als der September 1956.
* **Meeresspiegelanstieg**: In den letzten 140 Jahren ist der Meeresspiegel weltweit um fast 25 Zentimeter gestiegen, wobei ein Drittel dieses Anstiegs in den vergangenen 25 Jahren erfolgte. Besonders betroffen ist die Arktis, die sich schneller erw√§rmt als andere Regionen‚Äã.

F√ºr detailliertere Informationen und die vollst√§ndige Analyse empfehle ich euch, den Originalartikel im Guardian zu lesen: [The Climate Crisis Explained in 10 Charts](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/30/the-climate-crisis-explained-in-10-charts-co2-green-energy-cop28).

186mo0m,Rechtskampf eines peruanischen Bauern gegen Energiegigant RWE wegen Klimawandelauswirkungen,"In den peruanischen Anden entfaltet sich ein bahnbrechender Rechtsfall: Der Bauer Sa√∫l Luciano Lliuya h√§lt den deutschen Energiekonzern RWE f√ºr die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels verantwortlich. Dieser beispiellose Rechtsfall basiert auf dem Konzept des ‚ÄûNachbarschaftsrechts‚Äú und RWEs Beitrag zu den globalen Treibhausgasemissionen, gesch√§tzt auf 0,47¬†%. Lliuyas Kampf begann in seinem kleinen Dorf Llupa und hat mittlerweile internationale Aufmerksamkeit erlangt, die ihn bis in deutsche Gerichte und zu UN-Gipfeln f√ºhrte.

Im Zentrum der Klage steht das Risiko durch das Schmelzen der Gletscher in der N√§he des Sees Palcacocha, das eine katastrophale √úberschwemmung in Lliuyas Region droht. Seine rechtliche Forderung ist nicht nur pers√∂nlich, sondern repr√§sentiert einen gr√∂√üeren Kampf f√ºr Klimagerechtigkeit, in dem gro√üe Verschmutzer f√ºr ihre globale Auswirkung zur Verantwortung gezogen werden. Der Prozess, der 2015 begann, hat mehrere Wendungen erlebt, einschlie√ülich einer anf√§nglichen Ablehnung in einem unteren Gericht und sp√§terer Zulassung in einem h√∂heren Gericht. Der Fall hat internationales Interesse geweckt und √§hnliche Klagen weltweit ausgel√∂st, was eine wachsende Bewegung gegen gro√üe Emittenten und ihre Rolle beim Klimawandel widerspiegelt.

Dieser Fall ist nicht nur rechtlich, sondern auch tief pers√∂nlich f√ºr Lliuya. Er hat Skepsis und Missverst√§ndnisse in seiner Gemeinde erlebt, bleibt aber standhaft in seinem Kampf, angetrieben von einer tiefen Verbindung zu seinem Land und den wachsenden Gefahren durch den Klimawandel. Seine Ausdauer angesichts von Herausforderungen ist emblematisch f√ºr einen globalen Kampf um Umweltgerechtigkeit und Verantwortlichkeit.

Ich m√∂chte mit euch einen k√ºrzlich ver√∂ffentlichten Artikel auf phys.org diskutieren, der sich mit ""Drei positiven Klimaentwicklungen"" befasst. 

Trotz der anhaltenden Herausforderungen im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel gibt es einige aufmunternde Fortschritte:

1. **Ged√§mpfte Erw√§rmungsprognosen**: Nach dem Pariser Abkommen hat sich die Prognose der globalen Erw√§rmung leicht verbessert, obwohl sie immer noch kritische Werte erreicht.
2. **Spitze der Emissionen in Sicht?** Es gibt Anzeichen daf√ºr, dass die j√§hrlichen Treibhausgasemissionen ihren H√∂hepunkt fr√ºher erreichen k√∂nnten als erwartet, m√∂glicherweise sogar schon in diesem Jahr.
3. **Aufstieg der erneuerbaren Energien**: Solar-, Windenergie und Elektrofahrzeuge treiben die Verbesserung der globalen Erw√§rmungsprognosen seit 2015 voran, mit deutlichen Zuw√§chsen in der sauberen Energie-Technologie.

Diese Entwicklungen zeigen, dass Fortschritte m√∂glich sind, auch wenn sie noch weit von dem entfernt sind, was n√∂tig w√§re. Was denkt ihr dar√ºber? Welche weiteren Ma√ünahmen sollten ergriffen werden, um diese positiven Trends zu verst√§rken?

Wenn Frau Klatten √ºber die Politik klagt, dass es zu viel Regulation gibt, ist das ein gutes Zeichen. Die entt√§uschenden Erfahrungen, dass Entscheidungstr√§ger und Regierende immer wieder das Klima vernachl√§ssigen oder ihm schaden, r√ºht unter anderem daher, dass klimafreundliche Entscheidungen nicht mehrheitsf√§hig sind wegen der massiven Abwehr aus der Bev√∂lkerung und der Wirtschaft. Selbst wenn entsprechende Entscheidung getroffen werden, kann es in der Umsetzung immernoch passieren, dass es keine Unterst√ºtzung f√ºr bestimmte Ma√ünahmen gibt. Dennoch ist jede politische Bewegung Richtung Klimafreundlichkeit dem Leben und √úberleben auf diesem gebeutelten Planeten dienlich.

Nat√ºrlich gibt es nicht ""die Politik"" oder ""die Wirtschaft"". Ich m√∂chte folgendes ausdr√ºcken: Wenn Frau Klatten als Vertreterin der Wirtschaft sich √ºber Regulation beschwert, lese ich das gerne als eine Emanzipation der Politik von der Wirtschaft. Gerne w√ºrde ich mehr davon lesen.

Das Deutschlandticket wird von ca. 11 Mio. Menschen genutzt (bzw. ist in deren Besitz). Die Finanzierung steht aktuell wegen ""l√§ppischer"" eine Milliarde Euro im Zweifel, eine Erh√∂hung des Ticketpreises w√ºrde die Akzeptanz deutlich reduzieren.

Was w√§re denn, wenn man einen ""√ñPNV-Beitragsservice"" einrichtet, √§hnlich dem Rundfunk? Durch die damit verbundene Vergabe des Tickets an alle Deutschen B√ºrger w√ºrde die Attraktivit√§t nochmals steigen - wenn man das Ticket ""ohnehin"" schon hat, wird es auch genutzt.

Im Gegenzug k√∂nnte man den Rundfunkbeitrag abschaffen, um den B√ºrger zu entlasten. Denn w√§hrend √ñPNV dem Klimaschutz viel Gutes tut und gesellschaftlichen Mehrwert liefert, tut es das andere nicht...

Und wenn die 18,36 dann monatlich an die √ñPNV-Anbieter gehen, kann die Qualit√§t nochmals deutlich optimiert werden!

17k2isv,"Das Argument gegen Degrowth, welches ich nicht widerlegen konnte","Hallo zusammen, auch wenn das Thema ziemlich umfassend ist, versuche ich mich einigerma√üen kurz zu halten.

Ich denke wir sind uns alle einig, dass unser aller Ziel das langfristige √úberleben auf der Erde ist. Die einen schlagen als L√∂sungsweg ""Gr√ºnes Wachstum"" vor, also die Entkopplung von Technologie und den daraus entstehenden Umweltsch√§den durch z.B. Erneuerbare Energien. Diese Diskussion soll aber das Thema Degrowth behandeln, also lasst bitte alles, was gr√ºnes Wachstum oder erneuerbare Energien beinhaltet, raus. 

Degrowth bedeutet, unsere Gesellschaft so umzugestalten, dass wir keine negativen Auswirkungen auf unsere Umwelt haben und weniger bzw. gleich viel Ressourcen verbrauchen, wie die Erde produzieren kann. Umgesetzt wird das durch ein Wirtschaftsschrumpfen, indem alle Sektoren, die nicht zwingend zum √úberleben ben√∂tigt werden, ""verboten"" werden. Zum Beispiel w√ºrde die Automobil- und Flugzeugbranche nahezu abgeschafft werden, im Gesundheitswesen und Bildungsbranche d√ºrfte es jedoch keine Einschr√§nkungen geben. Das meiner Meinung nach realistischste Szenario ist die ""Post-Wachstums-√ñkonomie"" von Niko Paech (ich behaupte nicht, dass dieses Szenario tats√§chlich realistisch ist, aber von alle Szenarien ist es immerhin am wenigsten abwegig). Wer sich daf√ºr mehr interessiert, einfach Niko Paech googlen. Im Prinzip ist Degrowth ein gro√üer Verzicht auf Wohlstand und Luxus, um so unser √úberleben auf der Erde zu sichern.

Nun das Argument, um das es hier gehen soll:

Wie ich schon erkl√§rt habe, geht im Prinzip alles darum, wie wir langfristig unser √úberleben sichern k√∂nnen. Dabei ist vor allem der Klimawandel in den letzten Jahren stark aufgekocht und wird als Hauptbedrohung angesehen. Leider wird schnell vergessen, dass der Klimawandel weder die einzige, noch die wahrscheinlichste Bedrohung f√ºr uns ist.

Alle ""gro√üen"" Bedrohungen lassen sich praktisch in zwei Kategorien unterteilen: Nat√ºrliche Bedrohungen (z.B. Supervulkan-Ausbruch, Pandemie, Asteroid) und menschengemachte Bedrohungen (Atomkrieg, KI, Klimawandel). Es ist wichtig zu verstehen, dass die Menschheit unglaublich resilient ist. Trifft eine dieser Bedrohungen ein, w√ºrden wir zwar gro√üe Sch√§den davontragen, jedoch w√ºrden wir uns aufgrund unserer Resilienz ""schnell"" wieder aufbauen und weiterleben k√∂nnen. Zum Beispiel w√ºrden bei einem Atomkrieg ca. 40% aller Menschen √ºberleben, was momentan 3,2 Milliarden Menschen und somit mehr Menschen, als es im Jahre 1950 √ºberhaupt auf der Erde gab, entsprechen w√ºrde. Bei den anderen Bedrohungen ist es √§hnlich. Tats√§chlich gibt es nur **ein einziges** Szenario, dass uns als menschliche Spezies tats√§chlich ernsthaft und bleibend sch√§digen k√∂nnte: Eine Ansammlung mehrerer dieser Bedrohungen innerhalb einer kurzen Zeitspanne (z.B. Klimawandel -> 200 Jahre sp√§ter Atomkrieg -> 300 Jahre sp√§ter Pandemie).

Nun zum Degrowth. Der Vorteil von Degrowth besteht darin, dass keine menschengemachten Bedrohungen entstehen w√ºrden, weil keine Technologien erforscht werden, die √ºber √úberlebensnotwendiges hinaus gingen. Also keine Gefahr durch Klimawandel, KI, Atomkrieg usw.. Jedoch geht es hier nicht um einzelne Bedrohungen, sondern um das einzige wirklich gef√§hrliche Szenario, n√§mlich eine Akkumulation dieser Bedrohungen. Das Problem ist, dass wir vor nat√ºrlichen Bedrohungen, die rein statistisch gesehen mit sehr hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit in der Zukunft auftreten werden, nicht gesch√ºtzt w√§ren, weil wir f√ºr dessen Bew√§ltigung gerade diese Technologien ben√∂tigen, die wir in einer Degrowth-√ñkonomie nie erforschen w√ºrden. Ich wei√ü, dass technologischer Fortschritt nicht mit dem BIP zusammenh√§ngt. In einer Degrowth √ñkonomie m√ºsste der technologische Fortschritt jedoch trotzdem deutlich eingeschr√§nkt werden, da sie sonst weder ihr Ziel erf√ºllt, noch realistisch umsetzbar w√§re. Demnach MUSS es eine Stagnation oder mindestens eine Verlangsamung des technologischen Fortschritts geben, wenn eine Degrowth-√ñkonomie in der Realit√§t implementiert werden soll. Mehr dazu wie gesagt bei Niko Paechs Versuch, ein m√∂glichst realistisches Szenario aufzubauen. Durch Degrowth w√§ren wir also vor menschengemachten Bedrohungen gesch√ºtzt, verlieren jedoch die F√§higkeit, gegen eine Akkumulation gewappnet zu sein.

Mir ist bewusst, dass der Weg des ""gr√ºnen Wachstums"" auch Gefahren und Probleme aufweist, aber wie gesagt soll es hier um Degrowth gehen. Ich m√∂chte hiermit eher auf das Dilemma aufmerksam machen, in dem wir uns befinden.

Also was denkt ihr dar√ºber? Nach diesem Argument w√§re Degrowth leider auch keine L√∂sung, sondern eher unser Untergang. Wir w√ºrden dadurch jegliche Kontrolle abgeben.  


&#x200B;

Anmerkung: Bitte versucht, √ºber dieses Argument zu diskutieren und nicht √ºber andere Sachen wie z.B. die Umsetzbarkeit einer Degrowth-√ñkonomie. Das w√ºrde den Rahmen komplett sprengen. Lasst uns einfach davon ausgehen, dass wir in der Post-Wachstums-√ñkonomie von Niko Paech leben w√ºrden, auch wenn das wohl nie passieren wird.",7,46,2023-10-30 16:15:29,de

Sc. in Physik im Heimtland meiner Eltern, wo ich die Mittel- und Hochschule absolviert habe. Mit 30, mache ich mir jetzt √ºber einen Master und eventuell PhD gedanken, und ob ich es vielleicht in Deutschland machen soll, und daher habe ich auch intensiv angefangen, mich mit der deutschen Politik zu besch√§ftigen, da ich glaube, dass dies die civile Verantwortung jedes einen ist, der in einem Land leben m√∂chte. 

Mir wurde w√§hrend meines Studium beigebracht, das Kernkraft, komperativ zur Kohle, die weit aus ""ges√ºndere"" Option sei, da nach allen Daten weltweit, sind weniger Menschen pro kWh an Krebs und √§hnlichen erkrankt, als von Kohleenergie. Und die Differenz sei auch nicht klein, sondern extrem gro√ü. Desweiteren, verschmutzt es L√§nder ""in der dritten Welt"", weit aus weniger Uranium (das ja auch sicher ist wen es nicht angereicht ist) abzubauen, als Cobalt und co. 

Ich kann auch verstehen, das einige Deutsche vor dem Schalgwort: ""Nukleare Energie"" angst haben, jedoch wie ist es dazu gekommen, dass die anti-nuklear Welle so stark wird? Kohle-Lobby? Eventuell  gerechtfertigte Gr√ºnde die mehr mit der deutschen Au√üenpolitik oder mit der Geographie des Landes, zu tun haben, als mit dem wissenschaftlichen Fakten?

17152jz,Klimawandel und kognitive Dissonanz,"In einer Welt, die von Informationen √ºberflutet ist, k√∂nnte man denken, dass faktisches und wissenschaftliches Wissen leicht in das √∂ffentliche Bewusstsein eindringen w√ºrde. Dies ist jedoch weit gefehlt. Von der Leugnung des Klimawandels bis hin zu Bewegungen gegen Impfungen gibt es eine beunruhigende Kluft zwischen wissenschaftlichem Konsens und √∂ffentlicher Meinung.

Warum f√§llt es den Menschen so schwer, ihre Weltanschauungen angesichts neuer Erkenntnisse anzupassen?

Um dies zu untersuchen, k√∂nnen wir die von Sigmund Freud und Leon Festinger vorgeschlagenen psychologischen Theorien betrachten.

Sigmund Freud beschrieb mehrere ""narzisstische Verletzungen"", mit denen die Menschen im Laufe der Geschichte konfrontiert wurden:

Die kopernikanische Revolution: Wir erfuhren, dass die Erde nicht das Zentrum des Universums ist.

Darwins Evolutionstheorie: Die Menschheit ist keine besondere Sch√∂pfung, sondern ein Produkt der Evolution.

Freuds Psychoanalyse: Wir sind keine vollkommen rationalen Wesen; das Unbewusste beeinflusst unsere Handlungen erheblich.

Jeder dieser Durchbr√ºche ersch√ºtterte die selbstzentrierte Sicht der Menschheit auf die Welt und verursachte psychologische Belastungen und Ablehnung. Die Annahme dieser Wahrheiten bedeutete, eine aufgeblasene Sicht der menschlichen Bedeutung aufzugeben.

Auch wenn der Klimawandel ein dr√§ngendes Beispiel ist, ist er bei weitem nicht die einzige wissenschaftliche Wahrheit, mit der die Menschen derzeit zu k√§mpfen haben. Die Probleme reichen von genetischer Modifikation bis k√ºnstlicher Intelligenz, von Impfungen bis zu Theorien √ºber die Urspr√ºnge des Universums. In jedem Fall destabilisieren die wissenschaftlichen Fakten oft tief verwurzelte √úberzeugungen oder soziale Konstrukte, was zu einer Reihe defensiver psychologischer Reaktionen f√ºhrt.

Leon Festingers Theorie der ""kognitiven Dissonanz"" besagt, dass Individuen mentale Unbehagen erleben, wenn sie auf Informationen sto√üen, die mit ihren bestehenden √úberzeugungen oder Werten in Konflikt stehen. Dieses Unbehagen f√ºhrt oft zur Verleugnung oder Ver√§nderung der neuen Fakten, um sie in vorbestehende Weltanschauungen zu integrieren.

Wissenschaftliche Wahrheiten sind oft schwer zu akzeptieren, weil sie nicht nur individuelle √úberzeugungen, sondern kollektive Identit√§ten herausfordern. Ob es sich um religi√∂se Gemeinschaften, politische Zugeh√∂rigkeiten oder soziale Gruppen handelt, Menschen lehnen Fakten eher ab, die den Zusammenhalt und die geteilten √úberzeugungen ihres ""Stammes"" bedrohen.

Obwohl das Internet den Zugang zu Informationen demokratisiert hat, hat es auch eine Plattform f√ºr Echokammern bereitgestellt. Die Menschen haben nun den Luxus, nur die Informationen zu konsumieren, die mit ihren √úberzeugungen √ºbereinstimmen, was Ignoranz und Leugnung weiter verst√§rkt.

Das Verst√§ndnis der psychologischen Mechanismen, die es schwer machen, unbequeme wissenschaftliche Wahrheiten zu akzeptieren, ist der erste Schritt zur √úberbr√ºckung der Kluft zwischen wissenschaftlichen Gemeinschaften und der Allgemeinheit.

Wir m√ºssen den Einfluss von kognitiver Dissonanz, narzisstischen Verletzungen und Stammeszugeh√∂rigkeiten auf unsere Wahrnehmung der Gesellschaft erkennen. Nur dann k√∂nnen wir gezielte Bildungs- und Kommunikationsstrategien entwickeln, um Leugnung und Ignoranz entgegenzuwirken.",41,110,2023-10-06 02:23:56,de

Kein vern√ºnftiger Mensch kann das anders sehen, dass (globale) Regulierung und Bremsen des Wachstums notwendig sind, die wissenschaftlichen  Erkenntnisse dazu sind √ºberw√§ltigend. 

Wir Menschen wissen jetzt, wie wir Atomkerne spalten, wie wir eine KI erschaffen k√∂nnen, wie wir riesige Schiffe bauen k√∂nnen, die die Meere leeren k√∂nnen usw., aber wir scheinen nicht dar√ºber nachzudenken, wie wir all diese Dinge nutzen, so dass sie... uns nicht irgendwann schaden, auf uns zur√ºckkommen...

Eine kleine Ma√ünahme kann die Abschaffung des Zinseszinses sein, ein offensichtlich exponentieller Effekt. Aber globale, soziale, wirtschaftliche, kulturelle, wissenschaftliche Anpassungen sind notwendig ...

16qahyw,Klimaschutz und Kiesabbau am Beispiel Lochhamer Schlag / ·∫Ñ√ºrmtal: Drei Unterschiedliche Darstellungen,"Drei Darstellung zur Thematik von Klima- und Naturschutz und Kiesabbau.

Zun√§chst zur Bedeutung des Themas: Kies wird ben√∂tigt f√ºr die umfangreiche Baut√§tigkeit in und um M√ºnchen. Und der findet sich unter Anderem auf einer durch die Eiszeit gebildeten Schotterfl√§che im [W√ºrmtal](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%BCrm_\(Amper\)). Durch dieses flie√üt vom Starnberger See aus die W√ºrm, an der eine Reihe kleinerer Orte liegen, die mehr und mehr zum Teil des M√ºnchener Speckg√ºrtels geworden sind.

Die W√ºrm und der Wald im W√ºrmtal haben vielf√§ltige Funktionen: Sie absorbieren Wasser nach Regenf√§llen, stellen verbindende Biotope in der Voralpenlandschaft dar, bieten bei hei√üem Wetter wichtige K√ºhlung und sind [wichtige, stark genutzte und trotzdem wundersch√∂ne Naherholungsgebiete](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%BCrm_\(Amper\)#Verlauf). Kein Zweifel, dass der Fluss [von den Menschen in der Region geliebt wird](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ftsa&q=W%C3%BCrm+Baden+Gr%C3%A4felfing&iax=images&ia=images)!

Kies wird insbesondere ben√∂tigt f√ºr die Herstellung von Zement und Beton. Doch da die Herstellung von Zement zur Freisetzung von gro√üen Mengen von CO2 f√ºhrt, [sieht der Bund Naturschutz Deutschland diese als sehr problematisch f√ºr den Klimaschutz an](https://traunstein.bund-naturschutz.de/brennpunkte/kiesabbau-im-landkreis), und es gibt eine Vielzahl von regionalen Initiativen von der Nordsee bis nach Bayern und √ºber Europa hinaus, den Abbau zu reduzieren oder zu stoppen.

Hier drei Ver√∂ffentlichungen zum Thema:

* [S√ºddeutsche Zeitung: Streit um Kiesabbau kocht wieder hoch - W√§hrend das Kieswerk Gl√ºck am Sonntag das Betriebsgel√§nde f√ºr eine Besichtigung √∂ffnet, demonstrieren Natursch√ºtzer gegen eine geplante Ausbeutung im Lochhamer Schlag.](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/muenchen/landkreismuenchen/kiesabbau-lochhamer-schlag-kieswerk-glueck-tag-der-offenen-tuer-demonstration-kundgebung-1.6244898)

* [Stellungnahme des Kieswerk Gl√ºck](https://dialog-glueck-kies.de/): Hier wird betont, dass der Wald rekultiviert werden soll. Die Firma Gl√ºck betont auch, [dass Kiesbbau nun mal notwendig ist, da ein Bundesb√ºrger im Schnitt j√§hrlich 11 Tonnen mineralische Rohstoffe verbrauche, und argumentiert, dass es eine Art NIMBY-Haltung sei, diesen einzuschr√§nken oder verhindern zu wollen. Dazu k√§me, dass ein regionaler Antransport von Kies zu Bauprojekten in M√ºnchen klimafreundlicher sei als ein weiterer Transport. Den Klimasch√ºtzern wird billige Polemik vorgeworfen.](https://dialog-glueck-kies.de/regionale-kiesgewinnung-und-danach-ein-besserer-wald-2/).

* Der Zusammenschluss von Initiativen und Gruppen ""Rettet den Lochhamer Schlag"" [kontert dagegen, dass die Firma Gl√ºck auch rund um M√ºnchen weitere Kiesgruben in waldfreiem Gebiet besitze](http://rettet-den-wuermtaler-wald.de/lochhamer-schlag/), und eine Zerst√∂rung des Waldes unn√∂tig sei.

Nach [einem Bericht des Bayrischen Rundfunks wenden die Gr√ºnen ein, dass der Bedarf des Kiesabbaus fehlerhaft ermittelt werde und der Abbau daher rechtswidrig sei.](https://www.br.de/nachrichten/bayern/kiesabbau-in-bayern-wie-rechtswidrig-ist-er,TSZ79Vq).

16qv23r,Diskussion √ºber einen ganzheitlichen Ansatz zur Energieneutralit√§t von Wohngeb√§uden in Deutschland,"
Hallo liebe üá©üá™ Reddit-Community, 

ich m√∂chte heute einen Vorschlag f√ºr einen ganzheitlichen Ansatz zur F√∂rderung der Energieneutralit√§t von Wohngeb√§uden in Deutschland vorstellen.

1. Verbindliche Energiestandards f√ºr Neubauten

Wir schlagen vor, die international anerkannten Passivhaus-Standards als verbindliche Vorschriften f√ºr Neubauten einzuf√ºhren. Diese Standards garantieren eine hohe Energieeffizienz und minimale Heiz- und K√ºhlkosten. Zus√§tzlich sollten Smart Building-Technologien und erneuerbare Energiequellen wie Solar und Wind verpflichtend sein.

2. Finanzielle Anreize f√ºr energieneutrale Neubauten

Um Investitionen in energieneutrale Projekte zu f√∂rdern, schlagen wir die Einf√ºhrung von ""Pay-as-you-save""-Modellen vor. Diese erm√∂glichen es, die Kosten f√ºr energieneutrale Technologien √ºber erwartete langfristige Einsparungen zu finanzieren. Die Nutzung von Blockchain im Energiemanagement kann die Effizienz und Transparenz im Energiemarkt erh√∂hen.

3. Unterst√ºtzung f√ºr energetische Sanierungen von Bestandsgeb√§uden

Wir empfehlen den Einsatz von Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS) zur kontinuierlichen √úberwachung und Optimierung des Energieverbrauchs in bestehenden Geb√§uden. Zudem sollten dezentrale Energieerzeugungsl√∂sungen wie Mikro-Kraftwerke und Solard√§cher gef√∂rdert werden.

4. Konsequenzen bei Nichterf√ºllung staatlicher Energiestandards

Um sicherzustellen, dass staatliche Energiestandards eingehalten werden, schlagen wir verpflichtende Inspektionen und Technologie√ºberwachung vor. Unternehmen und Eigent√ºmer, die diese Standards nicht erf√ºllen, sollten mit Strafzahlungen und Geb√ºhren rechnen.

5. Die wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen

Die Integration erneuerbarer Energien ins Stromnetz und die Einf√ºhrung intelligenter Netze k√∂nnten die Wirtschaft ankurbeln und die Inflation durch die Verringerung der Abh√§ngigkeit von fossilen Brennstoffen d√§mpfen. Dies k√∂nnte dazu f√ºhren, dass Arbeitspl√§tze im Bereich erneuerbarer Energien und gr√ºner Technologien geschaffen werden.

6. Internationale bew√§hrte Praktiken

Wir sollten von internationalen Erfahrungen lernen, insbesondere vom nordischen Passivhaus-Modell und den niederl√§ndischen Konzepten wie ""Energie-Neutral Renovieren"". Diese Modelle haben gezeigt, dass eine Energieneutralit√§t in der Praxis m√∂glich ist.

7. Forschung und Entwicklung

Investitionen in Energiespeichertechnologien und effiziente Geb√§udetechnologien k√∂nnen Innovationen f√∂rdern und den Weg zur Energieneutralit√§t ebnen. Neue Technologien wie innovative Batteriespeicher und effiziente W√§rmed√§mmungssysteme k√∂nnten die Effizienz erheblich steigern.

8. Bildung und Bewusstseinsbildung

Die Einf√ºhrung energiewissenschaftlicher Studieng√§nge und die Einbindung der Bev√∂lkerung in energieneutrale Projekte durch Bildung und Bewusstseinsbildung sind entscheidend. Schulprogramme und √∂ffentliche Kampagnen k√∂nnten das Verst√§ndnis f√ºr Energieeffizienz und erneuerbare Energien f√∂rdern.

9. Partnerschaften mit der Privatwirtschaft

√ñffentlich-private Partnerschaften zur Entwicklung und Implementierung innovativer Technologien sowie zum Transfer von Technologien aus der Privatwirtschaft in den √∂ffentlichen Sektor k√∂nnen die Umsetzung beschleunigen. Diese Partnerschaften k√∂nnten dazu beitragen, private Investitionen in Energiel√∂sungen zu lenken.

10. √úberwachung und Anpassung

Kontinuierliche Datenerfassung und predictive Maintenance k√∂nnen sicherstellen, dass die gesteckten Ziele erreicht werden, indem sie die Effizienz von Energiesystemen verbessern. Diese Daten k√∂nnten f√ºr die st√§ndige Optimierung von Energieverbrauch und -erzeugung genutzt werden.

Lasst uns gemeinsam dar√ºber diskutieren, wie Deutschland diesen ganzheitlichen Ansatz zur Energieneutralit√§t von Wohngeb√§uden umsetzen kann. Eure Meinungen und Ideen sind gefragt!",0,23,2023-09-24 07:08:23,de

16kvvj1,"Problem korrekt erkannt, aber falsche Schlussfolgerung - ein kurzer Rage (Diskussion willkommen)","Ich denke mal, dass es hier im Forum allgemeiner Konsens sein sollte, dass die aktuellen Klimaver√§nderungen zum gro√üen Teil durch den Menschen bedingt sind (auch wenn es nat√ºrliche Klimaschwankungen schon immer gab, beschleunigt der Mensch dies gerade enorm).

Und auch, dass die Klimaver√§nderungen - sowie die massive Vernichtung von Umwelt und die Verschmutzung unserer √ñkosysteme - eine riesige Gefahr darstellen, d√ºrfte keine √úberraschung sein.

Aber die Schlussfolgerungen, die man in gewissen Kreisen sowie auch hier im Forum h√∂rt, sind teilweise, um es nett zu formulieren, dezent daneben.

Selbst wenn DE nicht nur alle Autos verbietet und co, selbst wenn Deutschland von heute auf morgen komplett verschwindet, alle Einwohner und alle Infrastruktur weggezaubert, w√ºrde es allenfalls die √Ñnderungen dezent verlangsamen (ca. 2% des weltweiten Aussto√ü an CO2 sind von uns), dies w√ºrde nur die j√§hrliche Zusatzmenge CO2 reduzieren, eine Redukation der absolut vorhandenen Mengen und damit ein Abbrechen des Klimawandels w√ºrde nicht mal n√§her kommen...

Wichtiger ist es somit (pers√∂nliche Meinung), dass Deutschland 

* sich durch Bildung und Forschung daran beteiligt, umweltfreundlichen L√∂sungen und Technologien zu entwickeln und diese auch an andere L√§nder zu liefern;
* die eigene Infrastruktur anzupassen um gegen zuk√ºnftige Gro√üschadensereignisse gesch√ºtzt zu sein (bessere Abwassersysteme, Landwirtschaft in geschlossenen Systemen, Geb√§ude robuster bauen)
* nicht den Wohlstand der B√ºrger f√ºr kurzfristige und (weltweit gesehen) irrelevante CO‚ÇÇ-Reduktionen zu riskieren, denn es bestehen zwei Gefahren: Wenn die Menschen √ºber Geb√ºhr belastet werden und kein sozialer Ausgleich vorliegt, Wohnen und Leben immer teurer wird und der Wohlstand im Verh√§ltnis zu anderen L√§ndern sinkt, wird die Bereitschaft zum Umweltschutz sinken und radikale Parteien erhalten Aufschwung & andere L√§nder schauen nat√ºrlich was wir machen, und wenn diese sehen, dass wir gesellschaftlich selbstzerst√∂rerisch handeln, werden diese kein Vorbild an uns nehmen, sondern eher noch mehr motiviert sein, auf Klimaschutz zu pfeifen.

Wir sollten langsam als Gesellschaft von unserem hohen Ross herunterkommen und wie Ingenieure denken: Wie kann man m√∂glichst effizient und effektiv die Natur sch√ºtzen, ohne den gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhalt zu gef√§hrden.",5,134,2023-09-17 05:09:04,de

16k3k24,Nationalpark Ostsee,"Moin zusammen,
ich wei√ü nicht, wie sehr dieses Thema hier passt aber wie steht ihr zum Thema Nationalpark Ostsee.
Ich habe mir noch keine abschlie√üende Meinung gebildet und w√ºrde gern die Argumente der Gegenseite verstehen. 

Mich macht es hingegen wieder einmal sehr stutzig, warum dieses Thema schon wieder so viel Gegenwind erzeugt? 

Warum denken wir Menschen auch hier wieder als erstes an unsere kurzfristigen Interessen wie Wirtschaft, Tourismus und waswei√üichnicht? 
Wieso k√∂nnen die Belange der Natur auch hier wieder nicht mal √ºber unsere Interessen gestellt werden?
Selbst wenn man auf unsere Interessen schaut, profitiert der Tourismus und die ‚ÄûWirtschaft‚Äú ja langfristig von einer intakten, naturbelassenen und sch√∂nen Umwelt (bzw. Mitwelt). Die Menschen machen ja gerade dort Urlaub, weil die Natur so sch√∂n ist - nur etwas daf√ºr langfristig tun, sei es allein ein wenig passive Einschr√§nkungen haben, will dann doch niemand. 

Gerade Orte, die von uns zugebaut und verschandelt und intensiv genutzt werden, sind dann irgendwann nicht mehr sch√∂n und keiner will mehr hin.

Beispiel Fehmarn: diese Insel ist √ºberall wo der Mensch eingegriffen hat so unfassbar h√§√ülich! √úberall monokulturelle Landwirtschaft, die W√ºsten bis zum Horizont schafft und h√§ssliche Orte mit furchtbaren Neubausiedlung und wenig historischen Bauten. Lediglich die Naturbelassenen Gebiete wie Wallnau und der gr√ºne Brink sind noch sch√∂n.

[https://idw-online.de/de/news?print=1&id=820362](https://idw-online.de/de/news?print=1&id=820362) \- Artikel

Kurze Zusammenfassung:

Eine neue Studie zeigt, dass die Ersetzung von 50% der Fleisch- und Milchprodukte durch pflanzliche Alternativen bis 2050 die Treibhausgasemissionen im Zusammenhang mit Landwirtschaft und Landnutzung um 31% reduzieren und die Degradierung von W√§ldern und nat√ºrlichen Fl√§chen stoppen kann. 

&#x200B;

Insbesondere auf folgende Eckdaten achten: 

*""The authors found that a 50% substitution scenario would substantially reduce the mounting impacts of food systems on the natural environment by 2050 compared to the reference scenario. The impacts as compared to 2020 include:*  
*‚Ä¢ Global agricultural area declines by 12% instead of expanding.*  
*‚Ä¢ The decline in areas of forest and other natural land is almost completely halted.*  
*‚Ä¢ Nitrogen inputs to cropland are nearly half of the projections.*  
*‚Ä¢ Water use declines by 10% instead of increasing.*  
*‚Ä¢ Without accounting for any carbon sequestration on spared land, GHG emissions could decline by 2.1 Gt CO2eq year-1 (31%) in 2050 (1.6 Gt CO2eq year-1 on average in 2020‚Äì2050).*  
*‚Ä¢ Undernourishment globally declines to 3.6%, as compared to 3.8% in the reference scenario (reducing the number of undernourished people by 31 million).""*

Die volle Wirkung wird aber nur erzielt wenn die freigewordenen Fl√§chen wieder, mit Blick auf die Biodiverstit√§t, aufgeforstet w√ºrden. 

*""In the 50% scenario, the benefits from reduced land-use emissions could double as compared to a scenario without afforestation ‚Äì a total reduction of 6.3 Gt CO2eq year-1""*

Die eher unwahrscheinlichere Ersetzung von 90% der Fleisch- und Milchprodukte w√ºrde sogar die Reduktion der CO2eq pro Jahr auf 11,1Gt erh√∂hen. Im Blick auf die Biodiversit√§t w√ºrde dieses Szenario  den Biodiversit√§tsverlust zwischen 2030 und 2040 nicht nur stoppen, sondern sogar umkehren.

Die Studie gibt aber der Politik die Aufgabe die Probleme mit der Umstellung zu l√∂sen, es m√ºssen hier den Landwirten M√∂glichkeiten gegeben werden die Produktion umzustellen. 

Dies ist die erste Studie die sich den Thema Global angenommen hat, dabei ist auch ersichtlich geworden, dass es regional Unterschiede gibt, insbesondere auf den Blick auf die Reduktion der CO2eq. 

&#x200B;

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/lt42ff6apznb1.jpg?width=748&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b81fc0815be35d6c63256f59dc1f55cd550b3bfd)

Auf der Grafik sehen wir inwieweit sich die Umstellung auswirkt, ich m√∂chte hier betonen, dass die L√§nder die am meisten von der Umstellung profitieren, die L√§nder sind die Nachweislich am meisten vom Klimawandel betroffen sein werden und auch in CO2eq Rankings nicht besonders weit oben stehen, vor allem wenn man sich die Pro Kopf Statistiken anschaut.

&#x200B;

*""As a result, the 50% scenario achieves 92% of the previously estimated global land sector abatement in 2050 consistent with 1.5‚Äâ¬∞C temperature increase strategy. Restored land area in our 50% scenario reaches 58% of the Bonn Challenge targets and 13‚Äì25% of the target 2 from the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework for 2030.""*

Das sind Fl√§chen die wir, dringend ben√∂tigen.

*""We show that substituting 50% of ASF with novel alternatives can lead to profound system-wide impacts. Unlike previous studies that assessed dietary changes with novel foods, in this study we considered a more realistic composition of the plant ingredients that would be used to produce novel alternatives and analyzed them in a dynamic system-wide global framework. Instead of growing by 15% in the REF scenario, agriculture and land use emissions decline by 31%. A large part of this decline comes from CH4 reduction, which could have significant near-term climate mitigation benefits.""*

&#x200B;

Ich m√∂chte nat√ºrlich anmerken, dass das nicht eine Sache von Deutschland ist das zu retten, das ist Global eine Aufgabe die auch hierdurch ersichtlich wird: *""..., China consumes globally the largest share of pork (45%) and chicken meat (15%); USA leads in beef consumption (15% of the world total); and India consumes the most milk (21% of the world total)"".*

&#x200B;

Weiterhin m√∂chte ich noch auf eine neue Studie hinweisen die mir heute zugefallen ist die sich bez√ºglich Landwirtschaft auf die kurzlebigen GHG richtet: 

*""*[*We demonstrate*](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ace204) *herein that the choice of climate impact assessment has dramatic effects on interpretation, with GWP100 and GTP100 producing substantially different results due to their different treatments of CH4 in the context of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents. Given its dynamic nature and previously proven strong correspondence with climate models, out of the three assessments covered, GWP\* provides the most complete coverage of the temporal evolution of temperature change for different greenhouse gas emissions. We extend previous discussions on the limitations of static emission metrics and encourage LCA practitioners to consider due care and attention where additional information or dynamic approaches may prove superior, scientifically speaking, particularly in cases of decision support.""*

Eine Studie die untersucht ob die aktuellen Berechnungen mit GWP100 oder GTP100 als Statische Formeln ausreichen um den dynamischen Impact von den kurzlebigen GHG darzustellen und zu dem Schluss kommt das hier noch deutlich mehr Forschungs- und diskussionsbedarf vorhanden ist. 

*""As shown in figure* [*6*](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ace204#erlace204f6)*, GWP\* provides a shorthand approximation of how these change over time, rather than having to calculate a full temporal evolution of GTP for every year x. Figure* [*7*](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ace204#erlace204f7)*(A) shows the GWP\* CO2-w.e. from all virtual scenarios occurring in year 100 following sustained emissions of the GHG footprint: i.e. the same CO2-w.e. in figure* [*7*](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ace204#erlace204f7) *at year 100. Figure* [*7*](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ace204#erlace204f7)*(A) shows a similar pattern to the GWP100 footprints in figure* [*2*](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ace204#erlace204f2)*(A) but increased by around two orders of magnitude. This broad increase can be intuited straightforwardly as expressing CO2-eq impacts of 100 years' worth of recurrent emissions vs a single annual pulse. A similar relative valuation across different scenarios is also as expected, recognising some further connections between different emission metrics: as employed here, GWP\* is essentially providing a shorthand equivalent to the 100 years sustained sGTP‚Äîthe relative contribution to temperature change resulting from emissions sustained at the same rate for the defined number of years,...""*",14,2,2023-09-13 06:46:52,de

Neue Studie befasst sich mit der, nicht in Klimamodellen erfassten Abk√ºhlung im S√ºdlichen Ozean und Pazifik, diese wurde in aktuellen Modellen nicht abgebildet. Mittels der Anpassung eines Modells auf die tats√§chlich beobachten Werte, konnte der Negative Feedback Trend auf die Anomale Oberfl√§chenerw√§rmung zwischen 1979-2013 abgebildet werden. Die Abk√ºhlung hat dazu beigetragen, dass deutlich mehr Wolken entstanden sind und somit wie ein Sonnenschutz wirkt. In k√ºnftigen Prognosen wird aber eine Erw√§rmung dieser Ozeane erwartet, dieser Effekt wird die Wolkenbildung reduzieren und somit zu h√∂heren Globalen Temperaturen f√ºhren.

Die Autoren empfehlen deshalb die Modelle anzupassen und den Feedback der Wolken besser zu modellieren.",6,0,2023-08-28 02:52:51,de

15zw0yq,"Net-Zero, oder warum ein umdenken in unserer Lebensweise unumg√§nglich ist.","Ich denke die meisten die hier etwas mitlesen wissen wie ich zum Klimawandel stehe und meine √Ñu√üerungen zu der Notwendigkeit die besteht um uns aus dieser Misere zu retten. 

Im folgenden m√∂chte ich euch ein paar Grafiken und Studien vorstellen die sich meiner Meinung nach ganz gut zu einem Einheitlichen Bild zusammenfassen lassen k√∂nnen, ich mache das zum ersten Mal und bin f√ºr jede Kritik dankbar, without further ado:

&#x200B;

Viele behaupten der pers√∂nliche Einfluss w√ºrde keinen Unterschied machen, ich finde das ist einfach nicht weit genug gedacht. Jedes CO2 das ausgesto√üen wird, wird nur ausgesto√üen weil es ben√∂tigt wird. Unsere Lebensweise ist komplett Abh√§ngig vom Konsum fossiler Brennstoffe, deswegen ist auch ein Net-Zero immer verbunden mit ""residual emissions"", Emissionen die sich auch nach dem erreichen von Net-Zero nicht verhindern lassen, also nicht decabonisierbar sind. Wir alle als Individuum haben einen Einfluss darauf, wie gro√ü die residual emissions ausfallen.

Eine Studie in der Nature ver√∂ffentlicht, ""[Why residual emissions matter right now](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01592-2#Sec7)"", besch√§ftigt sich mit der Analyse von 50 der ""long-term low-emissions development strategies"" die seit dem COP26 von Regierungen eingereicht wurden. Die 50 Staaten sind verantwortlich f√ºr circa 20% der GHG Emissionen Weltweit. Deutschland ist nicht in der Analyse enthalten, die residual emissions in Deutschland werden mit ca. 5% der aktuellen CO2 Emissionen projiziert.

F√ºr die Analyse nimmt die Studie jetzt die 18 Annex l Staaten, aus diesen 50 eingereichten, und stellt die Ergebnisse dar.  (Verantwortlich f√ºr ca. 17,9% der globalen Emissionen)

[Why residual emissions matter right now](https://preview.redd.it/42chp25ze0kb1.jpg?width=743&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00b188941883950b8608d3e7d2c904732f2ecf77)

Das Ergebnis ist, dass in den ""most ambitious scenarios"" die J√§hrlichen Emissionen noch bei 2.2 Gt liegen. Das entspricht in etwas 18% der aktuellen Emissionen dieser 18 L√§nder, projiziert man dieses Ergebnis auf die Welt, verursachen wir auch nach 2050 noch in etwa 12 Gt CO2 Weltweit pro Jahr. 

&#x200B;

[Breakdown of residual emissions](https://preview.redd.it/4enezxcbg0kb1.jpg?width=745&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d6374dfd6aa6e9cd35929322ceb1dccc1c6dff5)

Zitat aus der Studie: ""*...analysis of net-zero and 1.5‚Äâ¬∞C compatible pathways from the scientific literature also anticipates that the majority of residual emissions will be from agriculture, with some residual emissions from industry and transport. Yet estimations of total amounts vary widely depending on scenario, and regional analysis is limited.*""

Selbstverst√§ndlich gibt es Strategien die sich genau mit diesen residual emissions befassen, aber leider werden auch hier keine Klaren Aussagen get√§tigt und vor allem wird auch auf ""carbon capture"" gesetzt, obwohl √ºberhaupt nicht klar ob das in den Ma√üe √ºberhaupt umsetzbar ist.

Die Politik wird hier an seine Grenzen kommen, denn die Emissionen die √ºberbleiben, sind Emissionen die wir alle verursachen, in dem wir Leben und versorgt werden m√ºssen. 

&#x200B;

[In a business-as-usual scenario emissions from food production alone could use up all of our 1.5¬∞C or 2¬∞C carbon budget](https://preview.redd.it/t994eoyai0kb1.jpg?width=778&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3de2318dba05eda67ba4ee7ad32230b98f417ac)

Auf der [Grafik](https://ourworldindata.org/food-emissions-carbon-budget#in-a-business-as-usual-scenario-emissions-from-food-production-alone-could-use-up-all-of-our-1-5-c-or-2-c-carbon-budget) sehen wir wie gro√ü der Anteil der Lebensmittelindustrie an unseren CO¬≤ Budget h√§ngt. Es gibt Studien die die Emission von unserem Essen auf [25-34%](https://ourworldindata.org/greenhouse-gas-emissions-food) der Weltweit ausgesto√üen CO¬≤e berechnen. Ein weitere Studie besch√§ftigt sich mit der Verteilung diese Emissionen auf die einzelnen Sektoren. Und beziffert die 3 Sektoren (Pflanzen, Tier, sonstiges) auf ""[57% corresponds to the production of animal-based food (including livestock feed), 29% to plant-based foods and 14% to other utilizations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00358-x)""

&#x200B;

[Aus der Studie \\""Global greenhouse gas emissions from animal-based foods are twice those of plant-based foods](https://preview.redd.it/x3jknp42l0kb1.jpg?width=510&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21d9bd31aa006882b2e09897518693c3db3b8bca)

Auf dem ersten Blick h√∂rt sich ""doppelt"" so viel nicht nach viel an, aber in der Studie wird auch nicht beachtet, dass durch das freiwerden von Landfl√§chen die Biodiversit√§t und unsere √ñkosysteme profitieren. Weiterhin werden auch viele dieser ""plant-based foods"" von allen Menschen konsumiert, auch diejenigen die Fleisch essen. Der gr√∂√üte Verursacher bei den ""plant-based foods"" ist der Reis, der auf der ganzen Welt als Grundnahrungsmittel dient.

[Eine weitere Studie](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2120584119) besch√§ftigt sich mit den Impact von verschiedenen Produkten (Insgesamt 57.000) die in den UK oder Irland gekauft werden k√∂nnen, dies ist vor allem dadurch erleichtert, da in diesen L√§ndern genau aufgeschl√ºsselt werden muss was in den Produkten enthalten ist. In der Studie wird ein Algorithmus entwickelt, der den Impact der Produkte auf unsere Umwelt und auf unsere Gesundheit sch√§tzen soll. Die Methoden werden sehr gut erkl√§rt und im unteren Teil validiert. 

&#x200B;

[ Aus der Studie \\""Estimating the environmental impacts of 57,000 food products](https://preview.redd.it/qlxyrvi2n0kb1.jpg?width=1721&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee0a99ad4347817ee03450894628edb572377476)

Ich denke das Bild spricht f√ºr sich und muss nicht erkl√§rt werden, alle Alternativen, sind deutlich besser f√ºr unsere Umwelt. Weiterhin ist auch interessant wieviel von unserem [Land aufgewendet wird um diese Tierprodukte zu produzieren](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use#definitions-of-agricultural-land-use).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hzf90iy0o0kb1.jpg?width=2039&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8a4888d17f1108208e2365f0c11980fa75bf884

77% unserer Landfl√§chen werden genutzt um 18% der Weltweiten Kalorien anzubauen und trotz der ""Protein"" Argumente auch nur f√ºr 37% der Weltweit ben√∂tigten Proteine.

Dabei kommt es nicht darauf an [woher unser Essen kommt](https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local), sondern es kommt darauf an was wir essen. Auch wenn nicht das gesamte Land genutzt werden kann um Lebensmittel f√ºr uns Menschen anzubauen, gibt es mehr als genug Landfl√§chen um unsere Pflanzlich zu ern√§hren. Vor allem wird auch auch das Wasser immer knapper.

Bleibt die Frage, wie sollen wir die Tiere aus der Nutztierhaltungen in der Zukunft versorgen, wenn wir es nicht mal aktuell f√ºr die gesamte Welt schaffen und wir aktuell circa 735 Millionen Menschen auf der Welt haben, die aktiv Hunger leiden.

Welche Zukunft m√∂chten wir formen? Es liegt an uns die verbleibenden CO¬≤e auf ein Niveau zu reduzieren, dass haupts√§chlich von der Natur ausgeglichen werden kann. Auf carbon capture setzen finde ich f√ºr h√∂chstgewagt und unsere Weltweiten nat√ºrlichen CO¬≤ senken verbrennen auf der gesamten Welt, oder werden f√ºr Tierfutter abgeholzt.

Auch wenn man das Gef√ºhl hat, dass das eigene handeln kaum Einfluss auf das Weltweite CO¬≤ Geschehen hat, muss man immer beachten, jeder Ver√§nderung und jeder Paradigmenwechsel, ben√∂tigt jemanden der vorausgeht. 

Irgendwer muss immer den Anfang machen.

15vgcxp,Waldbrandbek√§mpfung mit Extinguisher Balls,"Selbst, wenn wir in einigen Jahren klimaneutral w√§ren, werden diese furchterregenden Waldbr√§nde wohl zunehmen. Ich habe mich nachdem ich eines dieser Fire Extinguisher Balls Videos (wie das [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D709r6VKUxg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D709r6VKUxg)) gesehen habe gefragt, ob man diese nicht in W√§ldern strategisch anbringen k√∂nnte (naiv gedacht, aber lass uns das doch erstmal weiterspinnen).   


Warum geht das nicht?   
Es m√ºsste ein L√∂schmittel verwendet werden, das vollst√§ndig biologisch abbaubar und unsch√§dlich f√ºr Pflanzen, Tiere und Wasserquellen ist. Dies k√∂nnte eine Herausforderung sein, da viele der aktuell verwendeten Chemikalien in Feuerl√∂schb√§llen zwar effektiv gegen Feuer sind, aber nicht unbedingt umweltfreundlich. Die Frage ist, ob dies eine unglaubliche Herausforderung ist oder absolut unm√∂glich.  
Der Ball m√ºsste so konstruiert sein, dass er nur bei tats√§chlichen Br√§nden aktiviert wird und nicht durch andere W√§rmequellen, wie etwa intensiver Sonneneinstrahlung.  
Waldfl√§chen k√∂nnen auch sehr gro√ü sein. Um eine effektive Abdeckung zu gew√§hrleisten, m√ºssten eine erhebliche Anzahl von B√§llen in regelm√§√üigen Abst√§nden platziert werden oder man kreiert Waben. Dies k√∂nnte sich sowohl in Bezug auf die Kosten als auch auf den Arbeitsaufwand als problematisch erweisen.  
Die Frage ist, ob alles andere umweltfreundlicher und unproblematischer ist als dieser gigantische Aufwand?

H√∂chstwahrscheinlich ja, aber es ist komplizerter, als gedacht.","Dass der Klimawandel zu mehr Waldbr√§nden f√ºhrt, erscheint ja einleuchtend. Prof. Stefan Rahmstorf hat das in diesem Blogeintrag mal gut zusammengefasst: [https://scilogs.spektrum.de/klimalounge/hitze-braende-kachelmann/](https://scilogs.spektrum.de/klimalounge/hitze-braende-kachelmann/)

Neulich lief mir dieser Tweet des bekannten Klimawandel-Verharmlosers Bjorn Lomborg √ºber den Weg, der von vielen Klimawandel-genervten nat√ºrlich gerne aufgegriffen wurde:

https://preview.redd.it/jx9dq0gp1nib1.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=817c9dfd7376c7bc5429bf5b161f27428d04ac31

Ich dachte mir: Hm, interessant! Liegt hier wom√∂glich ein Irrtum seitens uns ""Klimawandel-Besorgten"" vor und das Thema ist vielleicht gar nicht so schlimm, wie wir glauben? Und tats√§chlich, auch das EU-Erd√ºberwachungs-System Copernicus stellt die Zeitreihe auf ihrer [Website](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/copernicus-extreme-wildfires-europe-south-america-and-north-america-2022) so dar:

https://preview.redd.it/euq3udha2nib1.png?width=555&format=png&auto=webp&s=6893d1927aaeffa21c0333f5bca417b9baaeaf9a

Ich habe jetzt gerade noch etwas zu Thema herumgelesen. Der Punkt ist: Die Daten werden vermutlich ungef√§hr schon stimmen. Und: Es ist sehr gut, dass diese Emissionen zur√ºckgehen. 

**Nur: Es gibt viele Gr√ºnde f√ºr Wald- und Buschbr√§nde und die dadurch verursachten Emissionen, Klimawandel ist nur ein Aspekt von vielen.** Eine genaue Aufschl√ºsselung der Brandursachen gibt es nicht, aber vermutlich modellbasierte Studien, so tief bin ich nicht eingestiegen. 

Wesentliche Ursache von Wildfires sind nicht nur nat√ºrliche Ursachen, sondern Land-Nutzungs-(√Ñnderungs-)Praktiken. Ein wichtiger Aspekt ist wohl, dass in Teilen der Welt das Abbrennen von Feldern verbreitet ist, auch das z√§hlt als ""Wildfire"". Diese Praxis hat in den vergangenen Jahrzehnten aber wohl nachgelassen. Auch z√§hlt das Abbrennen von Prim√§rw√§ldern (tropische Regenw√§lder) zu den Wildfires, die aber nicht durch den Klimawandel verursacht werden.

Insofern ist der Einfluss des Klimawandels auf die tats√§chlichen Emissionen aus Wildfires nicht genau zu bestimmen. 

Das World Resources Institute (WRI) [ver√∂ffentlichte](https://www.wri.org/insights/global-trends-forest-fires) die folgende Abbildung ""Verlust von Baumbewuchs durch Feuer"" basierend auf einer [Studie](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frsen.2022.825190/full) aus dem vergangenen Jahr:

https://preview.redd.it/wg436zag7nib1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=77710d029fc5cbd30fe35c9e32e7bf6476d197c4

In dieser Studie hei√üt es im Abstract: ""In boreal forests, fires are a part of the ecosystem dynamics, while in the humid tropics, fires are largely human-induced and lead to forest degradation."" Die Entwicklung des Baumverlustes in Nord-Amerika und Eurasien sollte den Einfluss des KLimawandels also ggf. besser abbilden k√∂nnen als der in s√ºdlicheren Gefilden. Schauen wir mal: Der Waldverlust durch Feuer in Eurasien (Europa + Asien ohne Ost- und S√ºdost-Asien, vgl. [diese Abbildung](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/825190/frsen-03-825190-HTML/image_m/frsen-03-825190-g002.jpg)) wird wohl zum gro√üen Teil durch nat√ºrliche Ursachen verursacht worden sein. In dieser Abbildung der Studie ist zu sehen, dass der Baumverlust durch Feuer in Eurasien zwischen 2005 und 2019 deutlich angestiegen ist. Allerdings ist ein entsprechender Trend in Nordamerika bis 2019 (!) nicht auszumachen:

https://preview.redd.it/duig75nk8nib1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e3eec32622e305aea9e8bb561653ca4f9525b3c

Mein Fazit nach einem Versuch der Ann√§herung: **Global** die Zusammenh√§nge bei der Entwicklung von Wildfires auf einzelne Einflussfaktoren wie den Klimawandel zur√ºckzuf√ºhren, ist komplizierter als zun√§chst vermutet und sehr schwierig. **Regional** sieht die Sache anders aus. Hier ist der Einfluss der klimatischen Ver√§nderungen auf √ñkosysteme eindeutiger zu erkennen - und das in vielen (wenn auch wom√∂glich nicht allen) Regionen gestiegene Risiko von Waldbr√§nden klarer auszumachen.
