wu9zny,The r/climatechange Verified User Flair Program,"r/climatechange is a community centered around science and technology related to climate change. As such, it can be often be beneficial to distinguish educated/informed opinions from general comments, and verified user flairs are an easy way to accomplish this. 

# Do I qualify for a user flair?

As is the case in almost any science related field, a college degree (or current pursuit of one) is required to obtain a flair. Users in the community can apply for a flair by emailing [**redditclimatechangeflair@gmail.com**](mailto:redditclimatechangeflair@gmail.com) with information that corroborates the verification claim.

**The email must include:**

1. At least one of the following: A verifiable .edu/.gov/etc email address, a picture of a diploma or business card, a screenshot of course registration, or other verifiable information.
2. The reddit username stated in the email or shown in the photograph.
3. The desired flair: **Degree Level/Occupation | Degree Area | Additional Info**  (see below)

# What will the user flair say?

In the verification email, please specify the desired flair information. A flair has the following form:

>USERNAME    **Degree Level/Occupation | Degree area | Additional Info**

For example if reddit user “Jane” has a PhD in Atmospheric Science with a specialty in climate modeling, Jane can request:

>Flair text: PhD | Atmospheric Science | Climate Modeling

If “John” works as an electrical engineer designing wind turbines, he could request:

>Flair text: Electrical Engineer | Wind Turbines

Other examples:

>Flair Text: PhD | Marine Science | Marine Microbiology
>  
>Flair Text: Grad Student | Geophysics | Permafrost Dynamics
>  
>Flair Text: Undergrad | Physics  
>  
>Flair Text: BS | Computer Science | Risk Estimates

Note: The information used to verify the flair claim does not have to corroborate the specific additional information, but rather the broad degree area. (i.e. “John” above would only have to show he is an electrical engineer, but not that he works specifically on wind turbines).

# A note on information security

While it is encouraged that the verification email includes no sensitive information, we recognize that this may not be easy or possible for each situation. Therefore, the verification email is only accessible by a limited number of moderators, and emails are deleted after verification is completed. If you have any information security concerns, please feel free to reach out to the mod team or refrain from the verification program entirely.

# A note on the conduct of verified users

Flaired users will be held to higher standards of conduct. This includes both the technical information  provided to the community, as well as the general conduct when interacting with other users. The moderation team does hold the right to remove flairs at any time for any circumstance, especially if the user does not adhere to the professionalism and courtesy expected of flaired users. Even if qualified, you are not entitled to a user flair.

I've also been on r/climate, and everyone there talks about how individuals need to take personal responsibility as well as being critical of corporations to truly mitigate the climate crisis. While I'm not in a position to do anything yet, since I'm still a dependent on my parents, it's a big factor in how I'll choose to live my life in the future. How can I as an individual lower my carbon footprint and influence change for the better? I grew up vegetarian, so I already have a plant based diet. My parents still aren't too sure of electric vehicles, and our cars are still too new to replace, so that's a big thing. They've heard stories from family friends about EVs not lasting a long time, and so my parents aren't too fond of them. All of my relatives live in a different country, so there is a requirement to go every year and visit them, and I know that the plane flight will also increase our carbon footprints, but it's unavoidable.",1,4,2024-09-29 19:16:33,en,climatechange

1fmhcxq,Part 113: The Great Heat Wave of Los Angeles - Human Desperation and Climate Catastrophe,"September 20, 2024  
  
By Zachary Ellison, Independent Journalist  
  
The heat dome descended on the Los Angeles Basin with unnerving certainty. For five solid days, temperatures rose above 100 degrees across the region before the forecast showed two days of cooling that would inevitably lead to high winds. For much of the summer, I had roamed the mountains, including in prior heat waves in August and July, but this one was far worse because the record-setting temperatures would spell an extreme temperature fluctuation. Already, the area had seen a series of smaller fires, a number of which the authorities had succeeded in rapidly extinguishing, a few after a good burn. The pressure was on to balance recreational access, fire prevention, and policing, including towards the unhoused population that so often is the first to have the finger pointed at them as the source of such incendiary conflagrations, even when it’s not true to the chagrin of advocates.  
  
Even the New York Times reported on the power outages that afflicted such an esteemed venue as the Hollywood Bowl. The grid was becoming strained. The Southern California Edison outage map showed losses of power across the region, restored as quickly as possible by crews. The County of Los Angeles issued instructions on how to make your own air conditioner: “Place a pan of ice between you and a box fan to cool the air down.” The advice wasn’t unsound, but for those on the streets who didn’t have electricity, the advice didn’t apply. Cooling centers were opened, and activists were able to push the City of Los Angeles at least to stop sweeping people, but not more broadly across the County. Then the fires started, first in neighboring San Bernardino, then in the forest above Glendora, and to the south in sprawling Orange County. The great heat wave had brought predictable disaster.

While a lot of climate careers seem to focus on areas that are already well-known or getting a lot of investment, I’m interested in finding ways to help people in underfunded and high-risk places. I’d love any advice on how I can work in a field that helps these communities specifically, whether it’s through policy, law, aid work, or another path.

1fngn4b,Change My Mind (seriously),"Hello all. I am a climate change denier (for now), but I have recently become much more open minded in general and am ready to change my positions upon being presented with enough evidence. So here are my questions:

1. What are all the negatives of climate change, and what evidence is there to suggest that the negatives outweigh the positives?
2. Global energy production must triple over the course of the next decade. What practically feasible strategy could accomplish this while simultaneously reducing carbon-emitting energy sources?
3. Climate change rates have historically been exaggerated. Why should we trust the current predictions?
4. Is reducing carbon emissions really a more practical solution than adaptation through seawalls and other means and if so, why?

These are all genuine questions and I really am open to having my mind changed. Would love to hear your input.

EDIT: I acknowledge issues with two of my questions. #2 was based on faulty data. The increase is only 25%-30%, not triple, though even at that level of increase, the question still stands. #3 was anecdotal and based on politician's portrayal of what the science said rather than the science itself, so likely inaccurate. 

I would also like to clarify that ""climate change denier"" isn't really a great way to describe my position. It's more so that I haven't been presented with enough evidence to be convinced that climate change is so disastrous, it's worth majorly damaging our global economy in an attempt to solve or even just reduce it. 

Last clarification; I understand these are complex questions that can't be fully explored in a Reddit thread. Please feel free to instead point me in the right direction of where to find these answers for myself, though direct comments are very much appreciated. ",0,102,2024-09-23 05:48:23,en,climatechange

I have googled this and the explanations all look like propaganda based on a belief that the end justifies the means. Please give good scientifically understandable answers that you actually understand for yourself rather than just parroting off someone else's rationale.

ps I am not a climate denier, just someone that doesn't believe that the end justifies the means, as well as having a lifelong passion for science and the weather. I own 40 acres where I am planting rainforest trees and export twice as much solar electriciry as I use.

Edit: most people answering so far don't understand the question. It is obvious that more CO2 is going into the air than is being dissolved in rain. Hence the build up of CO2. Note that your soda drinks are CO2 dissolved in water, so CO2 does dissolve in falling rain and be washed out of the atmosphere. There is a hell of a lot of rain on the planet so CO2 doesn't need to be very soluble for lots to be washed out of the air by dissolving in rain. The question was about how long CO2 stays in the atmosphere on average before being ""washed out"". What I want to know is that given CO2 does dissolve in rain, why do they say CO2 stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of years on average?",0,96,2024-09-22 18:20:01,en,climatechange

I'd love if any adults residing in the U.S. (and territories) would be willing to take my 10-15 min long survey and share the link with others. The aim of my study is to help people improve their mental well-being and fight back against climate change by collecting information on how different coping strategies moderate the relationship between experienced climate change anxiety and engagement with pro-environmental behaviors.

He’s getting frustrated watching the news and says everything he’s read shows that CC is not anthropogenic.
He’s skeptics of modelling and focuses on the times it has been wrong , debunking al gore all over the place. He is mostly infuriated by the fear mongering and the idea that small changes by an individual will make a dent in slowing its process. 

Any resources, (books preferably) that aren’t fear inducing with up to date info would be gratefully appreciated.

Im not a great debater so any argument points for help me present the argument would be useful!

1flp4ze,Paper: The 2023 Record Temperatures: Correlation to Absorbed Shortwave Radiation Anomaly,"https://scienceofclimatechange.org/wp-content/uploads/Olilla-Record-Temperature-2023.pdf

Abstract:

According to the paradigm of the IPCC global warming is solely due to anthropogenic causes. Record-high temperatures have been measured for the summer months of 2023 and the anthropo- genic climate drivers – mainly greenhouse gases - have been named as culprits. Simple analyses reveal that the temperature increase of the year 2023 cannot be explained exclusively by anthro- pogenic climate drivers. The hypothesis of this study is to show that the main climate driver for the high temperature of 2023 has been the Absorbed Shortwave Radiation (ASR). The approach has been to apply the CERES (Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System) satellite radiation measurements, which started in March 2001. Simple climate models have been applied since General Climate Models (GCM) cannot simulate cloudiness and shortwave radiation (SW) changes properly. The ASR changes are related mainly to cloudiness and aerosol particle changes. Since 2014 the global surface temperature growth rate has accelerated but this does not apply to anthropogenic climate drivers, and therefore the ASR changes are probably related to external forcings. The total Radiative Forcing (RF) according to the AR6 was 2.70 Wm-2 for the period 1750-2019. This can be compared to the change in the ASR, which was 2.01 Wm-2 from the year 2000 to the year 2023. This finding means that natural climate drivers have altogether an im- portant role in recent global warming.",0,10,2024-09-20 19:05:11,en,climatechange

Navigating New Horizons: A global foresight report on planetary health and human wellbeing 

What is foresight and how does it compare to prediction? 

""Prediction is passive: it means locking in a vision of the future. Foresight is about imagining the future and then looking at how to change it.""

Here, the report draws on a wide diversity of disciplines and voices to foresee the future. 

The report focuses on the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste, but also combines with other key drivers of change, including social, technological, geopolitical, and AI, among many others. Indeed, we are facing a 'policrisis', whereby the triple planetary is impacting and exacerbating human crises like conflicts for resources and declining health. Taking a holistic view is important for understanding the whole situation. 

It identifies old and emerging challenges that require immediate attention and have the potential to drastically impact planetary health. Eight critical global shifts or phenomena that emerged from the foresight process.

1. The relationship between humans and the environment in flux

2. Critical resources: scarcity, competition and the shifting dynamics of global security

3. AI, digital transformation and technology – a wave of change

4. A new era of conflict

5. Mass forced displacement and migration

6. Persistent and widening inequalities

7. Misinformation, declining trust, and polarization

8. Polycentricity and diffusion of governance

""Adopting agile and reflexive governance—with shorter-term time-bound targets to enable course correction combined with multi-layered monitoring at the UN level—would significantly enhance achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Placing a new global emphasis on wellbeing metrics rather than pure economic growth will help the transformation needed. The future must be consultative, multilateral, cooperative and integrate the voices of traditionally marginalised groups, including women, youth, local communities and Indigenous Peoples.""

1fhde02,"Methane Levels at 800,000-Year High: Stanford Scientists Warn That We Are Heading for Climate Disaster
","<<**Global methane emissions have surged, undermining efforts to curb climate change. Human activities continue to drive emissions from fossil fuels, agriculture, and wetlands, pushing warming beyond safe limits.**

Methane emissions, a major contributor to climate change, have continued to rise without slowing down. Despite a global pledge by over 150 nations to reduce emissions by 30% this decade, new research reveals that global methane emissions have surged at an unprecedented rate over the past five years.

The trend “cannot continue if we are to maintain a habitable climate,” the researchers write in a Sept. 10 perspective article in *Environmental Research Letters* published alongside data in *Earth System Science Data*. Both papers are the work of the [Global Carbon Project](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/), an initiative chaired by Stanford University scientist Rob Jackson that tracks greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.>>

[https://scitechdaily.com/methane-levels-at-800000-year-high-stanford-scientists-warn-that-we-are-heading-for-climate-disaster/](https://scitechdaily.com/methane-levels-at-800000-year-high-stanford-scientists-warn-that-we-are-heading-for-climate-disaster/)

<<The current path leads to global warming above 3 degrees Celsius or 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century. “Right now, the goals of the Global Methane Pledge seem as distant as a desert oasis,” said Jackson, who is the Michelle and Kevin Douglas Provostial Professor in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and lead author of the *Environmental Research Letters* paper. “We all hope they aren’t a mirage.”>>

Here's a fascinating observation in the article about the impact of the pandemic on atmospheric methane accumulations:

<<Our atmosphere accumulated nearly 42 million tons of methane in 2020 – twice the amount added on average each year during the 2010s, and more than six times the increase seen during the first decade of the 2000s.

Pandemic lockdowns in 2020 reduced transport-related emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which typically worsen local air quality but prevent some methane from accumulating in the atmosphere. The temporary decline in NOx pollution accounts for about half of the increase in atmospheric methane concentrations that year – illustrating the complex entanglements of air quality and climate change.>>

Now that I'm serious about my future, I've joined local climate and environmental volunteer groups and reached out to adults in the environmental field for advice. Most of the people I spoke to work in areas like educating kids about the environment/climate change, waste management, or helping companies become more sustainable. However I'm not very interested in those areas. 

I'm good at English, reading, and writing, but not so good at math. I'm not sure if that's because I didn't try hard enough due to depression or if I just don't understand it. Part of me thinks that if I study hard enough, I could improve in math and science, but people often say you should focus on what you're already good at to be successful. I'm also afraid that even if I get better at math and science, university might become too overwhelming, especially with STEM courses and all the new adjustments. Some people suggest environmental law, and that doesn't seem to be a bad idea, but it would take me 8-9 years to get there. Plus, I’ve heard that environmental lawyers sometimes end up helping the wrong side. 

I want a career that will really help fight against climate change. With the predicament I'm in now, as a very confused 17 yr old, **someone give me some guidance and let me know what kind of university programs and jobs are out there that have the most positive impact on climate change**.

I remember it following multiple storylines and between 2007 and 2077. one storyline was in Africa, I assume the Sahel region. Desertification became so bad in his village that he decided to migrate accross the Sahara to Europe. Eventually he arrived at some sort of facility in the North of Morocco where he took a train to Europe. Eventually he started working on an orange farm in France. Another storyline followed this french farmer who had to switch to producing orange due to the increasingly drier conditions in France. I remember a shot of Paris with a lot of vegetation as well. 
Another storyline followed a pregnant woman in northern Europe, maybe Germany. Devastating rainfalls occurred at the same time as she was going into labor. 
I believe there were more storylines but those were the ones I remember.

","This article provides extensive information about August 2024 temperatures, including the spike in temperatures in the western U.S.

<<August 2024 was Earth’s warmest August in analysis of global data going back to 1850, and the past three months (summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere) were the warmest June-to-August period on record, NOAA’s [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/), or NCEI, reported September 12. August 2024 was 0.01 degrees Celsius (0.02°F) warmer than August 2023. Both came in well above all preceding Augusts, and the past 11 Augusts have all been warmer than any others on record....

Land areas had their warmest August on record in 2024, according to NOAA, and global ocean temperatures were the second warmest on record. The recent record heat in the oceans has brought on a global coral bleaching event, the fourth one in recorded history (1998, 2010, 2014-17, and now 2024).

However, there was stark regional disparity in this summer’s temperatures. Nine states centered on the Midwestern Corn Belt had summer temps averaging near the midpoint of the last 130 years, whereas the West and Northeast were scorching. Five states – California, Arizona, Maine, Florida, and New Hampshire – had their hottest summer on record, and 20 other states had a top-10 hottest summer.

Summers have gotten over 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit hotter over much of the Western U.S. in recent decades, and 1-3 °F hotter over most of the rest of the country (see Tweet below).>>

1few8ds,Water Vapor Hasn't increased in Arid Regions,"Those in the know here (just a few?) understand that CO2 alone cannot explain the global temperature increase.  The radiant exchange effect (i.e. greenhouse gas) is well-known and undisputed, but explains less than half the measured global air temperature rise.  Best to use change since 1958 since when accepted CO2 global measurements began at the Mauna Loa Station.  Earlier measurements around the globe by chemical methods are widely disputed.  Regardless, CO2 alone can't explain the temperature rise for any period.

Climate models include ""additional effects"", triggered by an initial rise from a CO2 increase.  The biggest effect is an increase in water vapor, since the dominant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.  This goes back to the 1800's, where the Clausius-Clapeyron relation was used to calculate an increase in water vapor due to an increased air temperature.  That is for steady-state conditions, with unlimited liquid water available to evaporate.  That is true over the oceans, yet air coming off large areas of ocean averages only 70% relative humidity (at all air temperatures), so isn't saturated (100% r.h.), which the C-C relation requires.  I haven't researched the reason, but expect it has to do with hot humid air constantly rising to colder elevations where it condenses and rains out.

Regardless of theories, has water vapor actually increased?

A Jan 2024 paper found that water vapor hasn't changed in arid regions.  A view of the globe shows most of the land is arid (Western North and South America, most of Africa and Mediterranean, Central Asia, Australia).  Summary for the public:

[https://news.ucar.edu/132936/climate-change-isnt-producing-expected-increase-atmospheric-moisture-over-dry-regions#:\~:text=A%20basic%20rule%20of%20climate,as%20the%20planet%20becomes%20warmer](https://news.ucar.edu/132936/climate-change-isnt-producing-expected-increase-atmospheric-moisture-over-dry-regions#:~:text=A%20basic%20rule%20of%20climate,as%20the%20planet%20becomes%20warmer)

The academic paper:

[https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2302480120#:\~:text=In%20observations%2C%20this%20increase%20in,arid%2Fsemi%2Darid%20regions](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2302480120#:~:text=In%20observations%2C%20this%20increase%20in,arid%2Fsemi%2Darid%20regions)

The actual data is much different than climate model predictions, which likely means they over-estimate future global warming.  One possible reason is that there isn't sufficient liquid water to evaporate and keep the r.h. constant at the higher air temperature.  If true, that would increase the specific humidity, which is what matters in radiant exchange (total mass of water vapor).

I also found these interesting earlier articles and papers:

2022 General description for the public (and any reader not already up to speed on the narrative):

[https://science.nasa.gov/earth/climate-change/steamy-relationships-how-atmospheric-water-vapor-amplifies-earths-greenhouse-effect/](https://science.nasa.gov/earth/climate-change/steamy-relationships-how-atmospheric-water-vapor-amplifies-earths-greenhouse-effect/)

A June 2022 paper found water vapor has increased \~1%/decade:

[https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022JD036728](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022JD036728)

They make this strange comment about the data sources which don't fit the narrative:

""... it seems possible that decreases in humidity in some data sets may not be real and we are confident that water vapor is increasing with warming of climate.""

So the data doesn't verify it?  Need to rely on ""confident""?

A July 2023 paper which found water vapor increased in the troposphere from 1980-2020:

**The possible debate resolution: The US federal government should make and enforce a binding commitment to achieving net carbon neutrality for the United States by 2050.**

I have a few questions.  
1. What is the definition of a binding commitment when it comes to environmental policy? Is it somewhat of a empty promise the government makes to comfort people or is it a set plan that needs to be executed by law?  
2. What happens in the scenario the government enforces a binding commitment and isn't able to reach carbon neutrality by 2050  
3. What would the binding commitment actually contain? Im assuming it would mostly be increased efforts to reduce emissions but I was also wondering if current carbon capture would play a role.  
4. How would a policy like this effect people on different socioeconomic levels

1fcjhpo,How common are carbon offsetting programs in large businesses?,"Hey, guys!  
  
I was wondering if there’s a way to measure total carbon offsets, particularly for large scale business.  
  
I recently had a client mention their company's offsetting program, where they track the environmental impact they make and try to balance it out at the end of each fiscal year. And it sounded pretty unrealistic to me.  
  
Here’s the thing: I get that reducing the impact from the start makes a lot more sense, but offsetting seems like an option too.  
  
So, I am actually curious to know how many companies actually spend money on this? Like, are businesses out there taking real steps to reduce the impact they've already made through their operations?  
  
I know a lot of the focus is on sustainable practices, like using fewer resources or going green from the beginning, but I wonder how widespread offsetting programs are in practice.  
  
If you know a company who is doing this (or even thinking of doing it/advertising about it), please mention their names below.

1fb1jsn,Off-the-charts warming in the Mediterranean. What's going on?,"I'm from southern Italy, in the middle of the Mediterranean basin. There is a weather observatory near me that has been active since the 1920s. The older data are incomplete and sketchy, but it's still a valuable time series that shows the dramaticity of climate change in the region. The data shows that there was a slow cooling trend between the beginning of the series and 1953, then a moderate warming trend until 1973, then another cooling trend until 1991, and then a much stronger warming trend that continues to modern day.

The most recent warming trend of the last 34 years has been much bigger than any previous trend. There is a 2.5°C difference between the late 1980s and modern day. That's approximately THREE times the global rate. And it doesn't look like it's going to stop anytime soon, in fact here is the list of recent records:

April 2018 was the hottest april ever

Overall 2018 third warmest year

August 2021 also the hottest ever

Overall summer 2021 third hottest

May 2022 second hottest

June 2022 hottest ever

December 2022 hottest ever

July 2023 hottest ever 

October 2023 hottest ever

November 2023 hottest ever

December 2023 second hottest

Overall year 2023 second hottest

January 2024 second hottest

February 2024 hottest ever

April 2024 second hottest

June 2024 third hottest

July 2024 second hottest

August 2024 second hottest

Overall summer 2024 second hottest (fitst place belongs to 2003)

Overall year 2024 hottest year ever BY FAR. Yes the year is not over yet, but at this point it's pretty much guaranteed that it'll end as the hottest year ever and by a huge margin. There would have to be a little ice age to bring the average down to non-record levels. 

I have cross-checked and confirmed these data and they hold true for much of the mediterranean, with small regional variations.

[A paper published last December](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad0f72) reported how insects responded to wildflowers planted on two solar farms in rural Minnesota.

From 2018 to 2022, researchers from Argonne National Lab visited the solar farms around 20 times to monitor the health of the plants and study the insects they attracted.

By the end of the study, the scientists had spotted almost 11,000 different insects, and they discovered that the number of native bees at the solar farms surged, growing 20-fold in just five years.

They even found monarch butterflies and their caterpillar progenitors in the fields. With pollinators facing a dramatic decline, habitats like this are essential.

Three out of every four plants in North America, including crops, depend on pollinators.

Luckily, the bounty of bugs these habitats attract spills over into surrounding fields.

In fact, more bees visit farms near the flower-skirted solar panels than visit those further afield.

1faip5g,The disaster of climate communication,"Someone just asked why do people believe climate change was a “hoax”. The answer is pretty simple: Because it is being communicated as if it was a hoax.

I could name a long list of ""not to dos"" and climate communication checks every single one.

- relating every weather event to climate change: great to keep the story running, horrible for credibility

- ""we have no time for discussion (thinking), act now!"" People have seen home shopping before.. ;)

- rich people stressing the urgency over climate, while having private jets, yachts or buying real estate at the beach

- when climate change is embraced by the radical left, calling for ""climate justice"" and the end of capitalism, that might cause instant rejection in one or two people

- ""climate experts"" making claims that prove wrong: very bad for credibility

- fixing such incidents by reinforcing the message instead of admitting the mistake: disastrous for credibility

- ""believe the science"": no, believing has nothing to do with it, rather explain the science! That brings us to the next point..

- why the hell do most ""experts"" not even know the science they talk about?

- before telling people a doomsday scenario, be aware that happened before, many times over. The record is not specifically pro doomsdayers.

- rejecting discussion and hiding behind ""the science is settled"" (which it never is), will not promote credibility

- talking points like a 97% consensus may sound convincing to the layman, but anyone with education knows it is not how science works

- ""look here, do not look there"": framing only goes so far. Even simple people understand a grid can not run on wind and solar only. Ignoring obvious concerns only makes them grow.

The question should not be why some people believe climate change is a hoax, but given the communication, why there are even people not thinking that way. Every single point I named is in a way self-contradicting. Superficially these promote the idea of climate change, but implicitly they argue the opposite.

I think why ordinary people believe in climate change rather has two other reasons, not said failed communication. For one they want to be good people, align with society and prefer to trust authorities. For others indeed the anti-capitalist notion is the attractive part. They do not care if it is true or not, despite sometimes glueing themselves onto the street, they just love the implications.

To fix this you would need to get the science out in the open, communicate it to the people. For some odd reason that is not happening. What people get taught about climate science and what it is for real, these are two different things. Just to give you an idea. Almost nobody knows what the GHE is, and no I am not kidding. It took the IPCC up to AR5 just to drop ""back radiation"" from its definition of the GHE. That is good and correct, but also embarrassing it took that long. Almost every single text book has it wrong to this day. Most experts still do not understand it correctly. It is a bit like in medieval times when everyone was supposed to live by the bible, but barely anyone knew what was written inside.",0,18,2024-09-06 11:57:46,en,climatechange

We were comparing the fuel consumption of myself (a gentle driver who owns a small, efficient car) and a co-worker (an aggressive driver who drives a pickup truck). 

My car is 2.0 L, his truck is 5.4 L. (x 2.7 displacement)

I drive at the speed limit, he drives twenty over along the same route (+ %20)

My car has a curb weight of 1270 kg, his truck is 2110 kg (x 1.66 mass)

If we assume those are all linear relationships for simplicity (they're not), it's not a far stretch to claim he uses triple the fuel I do. My car is quoted as producing 124 g/km of CO2. Using the same multiplier, he would potentially produce 372 g/km. 

Now imagine all the people (especially in North America) driving big, heavy vehicles that don't need to. Imagine how much extra emissions they produce every year.

Most people justify buying these vehicles either because they need the space, or they're safer. When everyone else is driving a big vehicle too, they aren't any safer, and studies have shown that 95% of pickup drivers do not use them for carrying loads. ",55,160,2024-09-04 16:28:18,en,climatechange

1f82oz9,Clean energy hit a new high last year. ,"[According to a new report](https://about.bnef.com/blog/clean-electricity-breaks-new-records-renewables-on-track-for-another-strong-year-bloombergnef), in 2023, for the first time ever, 40 percent of the world’s energy came from carbon-free sources.

Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that, last year, hydropower provided around 15 percent of the world’s power; wind and solar combined to meet 14 percent, while nuclear supplied around 9 and a half. 

And clean energy is poised for even more growth going forward.

In 2023, the amount of solar power installed exceeded the total amount of new energy built the year prior. 

And in the first half of this year, energy financiers have already invested $313 billion into renewables. 

As one of the report’s authors said, “If there are \[clean energy\] projects ready and able to move forward, the capital will come.”",68,61,2024-09-03 11:24:15,en,climatechange

Urban waterways across the United States have long been plagued by pollution, often becoming symbols of environmental neglect and degradation. Canals that once served as vital arteries for transportation and industry now face the consequences of industrial waste, sewage, and urban runoff. However, successful cleanup efforts from around the world offer valuable lessons that can be applied to America’s polluted canals. By examining case studies from New York to Singapore, we can explore effective strategies to restore these waterways and turn them into assets for communities and the environment.

# Gowanus Canal, New York: A Model of Advanced Techniques and Community Engagement

The Gowanus Canal in New York is one of the most polluted waterways in the United States, suffering from decades of industrial contamination and combined sewer overflows (CSOs). Designated a Superfund site, the Gowanus Canal cleanup combines advanced remediation techniques, such as dredging and capping, with community involvement. The strategy involves removing contaminated sediments from the canal bed and capping it with clean materials to prevent re-contamination. Additionally, measures to control CSOs, a major source of ongoing pollution, are critical to the project’s success.

Community engagement plays a vital role in the cleanup effort. By involving local residents in education and monitoring programs, the project not only improves water quality but also fosters a sense of stewardship among the community. The Gowanus Canal serves as a model for integrating advanced remediation techniques with community involvement, highlighting the importance of public participation in achieving long-term environmental goals.

# Thames River, London: Infrastructure Overhaul and Regulatory Enforcement

The Thames River in London was once infamous for “The Great Stink” of the 19th century, caused by severe pollution from untreated sewage and industrial waste. Today, the Thames is one of the cleanest urban rivers in the world, thanks to comprehensive cleanup efforts that included major investments in modern sewage treatment infrastructure and the construction of the Thames Tideway Tunnel. This tunnel captures and diverts sewage away from the river, significantly reducing pollution levels.

Strict environmental regulations have also played a crucial role in the Thames cleanup. By enforcing pollution controls on industries along the river, London has been able to maintain the river’s improved water quality. The transformation of the Thames demonstrates the power of infrastructure upgrades and regulatory frameworks in restoring urban waterways. This approach underscores the importance of long-term planning and investment in sewage and waste management systems to support the ecological health of rivers.

# Cuyahoga River, Ohio: The Impact of Environmental Legislation and Public Awareness

The Cuyahoga River in Ohio gained notoriety in the 20th century for catching fire multiple times due to extreme pollution from industrial waste. The river’s pollution became a national symbol of environmental degradation and helped catalyze the U.S. Clean Water Act, which introduced stricter regulations on industrial discharges. Cleanup efforts on the Cuyahoga included sediment removal, pollution controls, and habitat restoration initiatives, supported by public awareness campaigns that played a key role in driving community support for the cleanup.

The Cuyahoga River’s transformation from a polluted fire hazard to a symbol of environmental recovery highlights the importance of strong environmental legislation combined with public advocacy. The river’s recovery demonstrates how regulatory action, backed by community involvement, can drive significant environmental change and restore degraded waterways.

# Cheonggyecheon Stream, Seoul: Urban Renewal through Green Infrastructure

The Cheonggyecheon Stream in Seoul, South Korea, offers a compelling example of how urban waterway restoration can enhance both environmental quality and urban life. Once a polluted and buried stream, Cheonggyecheon was transformed through a major urban renewal project that uncovered and restored the stream as a naturalistic waterway. The project incorporated green spaces, walking paths, and natural filtration systems to improve water quality and enhance the urban environment.

Beyond its ecological benefits, the Cheonggyecheon project has boosted tourism, improved air quality, and created a vibrant public space for Seoul’s residents. This case demonstrates the potential for environmental projects to drive economic and social benefits in addition to ecological improvements, making it a model for urban waterway restoration worldwide.

# Singapore River: Coordinated Cleanup through Public-Private Partnerships

The Singapore River, once heavily polluted with industrial and domestic waste, underwent a comprehensive cleanup in the late 20th century that transformed it into a central feature of the city’s landscape. The cleanup involved modern sanitation upgrades, the relocation of polluting activities, and collaboration between government and private sector entities. Public-private partnerships were instrumental in funding and managing the cleanup process, allowing Singapore to address the river’s pollution effectively.

Today, the Singapore River supports businesses, recreation, and tourism, illustrating the impact of coordinated, multi-stakeholder approaches in urban waterway cleanup. This case highlights the importance of collaboration between government and industry in managing urban waterway cleanups, demonstrating that shared goals and resources can lead to successful outcomes.

# Danube River, Europe: International Cooperation for Transboundary Water Management

The Danube River, Europe’s second-longest river, flows through multiple countries and faces significant pollution challenges from agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, and untreated wastewater. The International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) coordinates efforts among Danube basin countries to manage and reduce pollution, focusing on nutrient reduction, habitat restoration, and international agreements.

The Danube’s cleanup efforts have led to substantial improvements in water quality and ecosystem health, demonstrating the power of regional collaboration and international agreements in managing transboundary water pollution. This case underscores the importance of cooperation among nations in addressing shared environmental challenges.

# Superfund Cleanup Strategies: A Blueprint for U.S. Canals

The U.S. Superfund program provides a framework for cleaning up the nation’s most contaminated sites, including polluted canals. The key strategies include:

* **Dredging and Capping:** Removing contaminated sediments and capping with clean materials to prevent re-contamination.
* **Source Control:** Addressing ongoing sources of pollution, such as industrial discharges and combined sewer overflows.
* **Community Involvement:** Engaging local communities in the cleanup process through education, monitoring, and participation.
* **Long-Term Monitoring:** Implementing continuous monitoring to ensure that cleanup efforts are effective and that re-contamination does not occur.

By applying these Superfund strategies, along with lessons from global case studies, U.S. cities can develop effective cleanup plans tailored to their unique environmental challenges.

# Applying Global Lessons to U.S. Canals

The successful cleanup of urban waterways around the world offers valuable lessons for addressing the pollution challenges facing America’s canals. Investing in modern infrastructure, enforcing strong environmental regulations, engaging communities, and fostering public-private partnerships are key components of effective waterway cleanup strategies. By learning from these global success stories, U.S. cities can transform their polluted canals into thriving, vibrant parts of the urban environment, benefiting both nature and people.

These case studies illustrate that with the right combination of technology, policy, and community involvement, it is possible to tackle the complex challenge of urban waterway pollution. By applying these proven approaches, America’s canals can be revitalized, turning them from neglected relics of the past into clean, healthy assets for future generations.#WaterwayCleanup #Superfund #GowanusCanal #ThamesRiver #CuyahogaRiver #Cheonggyecheon #SingaporeRiver #DanubeRiver #EnvironmentalRestoration #UrbanRenewal #CleanWater #PollutionControl #SustainableCities #CommunityEngagement #PublicPrivatePartnerships #ClimateAction",17,7,2024-09-02 16:00:54,en,climatechange

Our balcony is a bit isolated from direct sunlight,we tried planting different plants but all of them died except for the pothos and she keeps on putting out new leaves , I took some cuttings and placed them in three different pots , what was just 5 leaves is 50 leaves today , it definitely has some impact on the environment but that impact is extremely negligible , but it won't be when a thousand people do it or even a million , it's all about collective effort ,Imagine a million people plant a single cutting and one day that cutting could be 50 million leaves and it's really simple , u just need to take a cutting , put it in water for a few weeks or place it in a pot or you can just leave it in water and it will still happily grow ,u dont even need direct sunlight for it , indirect sunlight would do the job or even artificial light, it will grow well and if u provide it a support it will grow bigger leaves , imagine a billion people doing this, this could bring that positive change , 

Imagine placing this plant in those barren empty lands of Australia, they could produce a lot of giant leaves with fenastration, if provided the water or just solar panels as the sunlight there is extremely harsh 

  
Overall this idea may not be an original one , or even a helpful one but I just wanted to tell people about it , I may sound dumb or stupid ,even if we do something like this , it may not create that much difference as much as i am exaggerating it to be and climate change is a complex problem that won't be solved by pothos( we could consider monsteras as well) , we also need to protect the diversity of the ecosystem but I believe it's better to have 5 leaves than none at all ,it will always be a good thing , if you give that corner of your room some life",8,2,2024-08-30 14:16:49,en,climatechange

If Georgia has 90 days over 90 now and increases to 110, that's 20 days. Took me a few minutes to figure that out though. ",84,57,2024-08-29 14:50:34,en,climatechange

I recently read a couple of papers on the AMOC collapsing this century, maybe even as soon as 2037. Im not a climate scientist but I am good at analysing data.

So I looked at the sea surface temperature just off the coast where I am - Ireland.

This year in Ireland, summer has felt cooler than other years.

I downloaded the NOAA data and examined an area off the west coast: 50°N to 55°N, 15°W to 10°W. Sea surface temperatures for the North Atlantic have hit record highs over the past 2 years. So when I looked at the region off Ireland, unsurprisingly, 2023 was the warmest.

But 2024 from about mid May dips down below the 1983 to 2011 mean. It's the red line in this image.

Could this be an early indicator that the AMOC weakening is cooling the waters around Ireland? Or is this far too simplistic an analysis?

I am looking at reducing food waste while travelling, and while you may ask what does that have to do with climate change, let me explain in a succinct way. 

When we waste food, they end up in the landfill (if it hasn't been donated / converted to animal feed / etc). This produces methane which is rather harmful for the environment.

Why don't we incinerate? Because that produces harmful gas, that also contributes to climate change.

By reducing the waste we produce, we reduce the amount of pollution we are creating. Food is part of the waste, and I am interested in the travel aspect because I see that a lot, especially in planes, at the end of the trip. 

So my question is, how can we reduce food waste when we travel? ",3,19,2024-08-28 00:26:26,en,climatechange

1f3r8ne,Climate Denial,"Frequently I see people refer to climate deniers. I want to point out that climate beliefs are quite complex and people can not be divided into 2 groups, believers and deniers. Some aspects... 

1. Is climate change happening? It is, and always has done for many millions of years. Over the last 600 million years, CO2 has gone from 300ppm to 6000ppm back to 300ppm up to 2000ppm back to 300 ppm again and finally up to 420ppm quite rapidly. Temperature has also varied considerably having been 10 degrees warmer than present and lots colder also. We have recently (about 12,000 years ago) come out of an ice age but we are still in the very cold period as regards the long term. 

2. Are temperature and CO2 correlated? Yes they are, and tend to move up and down together. Over the recent ice age periods it is found that temperature changes PRECEDE CO2 changes by about 800 years. Over recent shorter time periods temperature changes still precede CO2 changes. I know if no research that contradicts this. This is a complex process and many contradictory explanations are given. 

3. Do humans emit large quantities of CO2? Yes, and it has been increasing rapidly over the period of human industrial activity. This is not a contentious area. 

4. How much do humans affect climate change? This is a contentious area and a large number of people believe that they know how to control the climate and that is mainly by reducing fossil fuel use. Three times there have been reductions in fossil fuel use, in the 1970s oil shocks, following the 2008 stock market crash and when covid caused lock downs. So we have an example of how effective reducing fossil fuel use is. It actually has no effect on the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere! Surprisingly, burning less fossil fuels does not even slightly reduce the the rate at which CO2 levels are increasing. 

5. Is global warming happening everywhere? It is happening much more in cities than in the country side. That is because of more tarmac and more also energy use in cities. Every use of fuels produces heat. This is called Urban Heat Island effect. In America it has been estimated that it amounts to 7 F or 4 C. That is many times more than the predicted effects of climate change. So it is very important to get this right. Some studies have shown that separating weather stations into urban and rural gives two averages, one increasing rapidly and the other more or less constant. It is claimed that this effect is removed from weather records. However the adjustments are often done in the opposite direction. 

6. Are disasters happening because of climate change? No, disasters happen because of bad weather events and these have always happened from time to time. Long term records show no trend to more disasters. 

7. Are there any benefits to warming and more CO2? Yes, they cause crops to grow faster and greening of deserts to happen. World wide more people die from the cold than the heat. Most people choose to go to warmer places for their holidays. 

8. Will warming lead to mass extinctions in the near future? No. Most of the species that people say will go extinct have been around for tens of millions of years and already experienced far higher temperatures back then. That is not to say that humans are not causing a mass extinction, because we are. We are wiping out forests and other habitats at an insane rate. In the last 3 decades, there has been a reduction of 90% in insect populations, and that includes bees and other pollinators. That will cause crops to fail and be a major threat to humans. 

9. Are people in this sub reddit aware of these different aspects? My observation is that they are not. They just automatically down vote anything that hints at denial of any aspect of climate change without understanding what they are doing. Please do your own research and question how you got your beliefs and discuss before down voting. ",0,35,2024-08-28 22:10:11,en,climatechange

1f2btdy,Can Individual Actions Truly Reverse Climate Change and Environmental Degradation?,"How much of a difference can I make to reverse the impact of climate change and minimize environmental degradation? 

I was asked this by a friend the other day, and the question has been spinning in my head ever since. 

I believe that each of us can do our part, but how effective can our solitary efforts really be? 

Here’s the answer I gave in the moment:

Collective action starts with individual choices, and even small steps can contribute to broader change. It's indeed important to recognize that the most significant impacts often come from those in positions of power, such as politicians, corporate leaders, and billionaires, whose decisions can shape policy and influence entire industries.

Given this reality, one of the most impactful actions we can take as individuals is to support and vote for leaders who are committed to addressing climate change and promoting sustainable practices. Now this isn’t easy either. 

Take the USA for example. The Democratic party is the one that takes this issue seriously, and campaigns on it. However, a Republican party controlled state, Texas, is leading the country in renewable energy production.  (not here to promote anyone, just mentioning)

The nuances of politics and policy are complex, and it’s crucial to stay informed and engaged beyond just voting, by supporting policies, initiatives, and organizations that push for meaningful environmental change.

Beyond the political sphere, there are practical steps you can take in your daily life to reduce your environmental footprint. This includes actions like donating to reforestation projects, buying second hand instead of new, reducing energy consumption, and supporting companies with sustainable practices. 

Every step counts, just as every misstep counts. Which is why it’s important to prioritize harm reduction as well.

During your thesis you were congratulated for your scientific rigor which did not fall into the trap of correlation / cause and precisely there is no study which establishes the causality of human CO2 activity and global warming ... and yet the IPCC has widely passed this idea ... which has not however prevented the German ecologists from restarting coal-fired power stations instead of nuclear power while this generates a lot of pollution: let's fight against CO2 pollution which kills  48,000 people per year in France, rather than blaming the population on global warming""

1ex7ata,Roles of Earth’s Albedo Variations and Top-of-the-Atmosphere Energy Imbalance in Recent Warming: New Insights from Satellite and Surface Observations,"Analogous to the famous “follow-the-money” approach often adopted by the social and political sciences to explain human behavior and social movements, this study can be described as a “follow-the-energy” journey to investigate the causes of recent climate warming.

These findings call for a fundamental reconsideration of the current paradigm of understanding about climate change and related socio-economic initiatives aimed at drastic reductions of industrial carbon emissions at all costs. An important aspect of this paradigm shift should be the prioritized allocation of funds to support large-scale interdisciplinary research into the physical mechanisms controlling the Earth’s albedo and cloud physics, for these are the real drivers of climate on multidecadal time scales.

The IPCC AR6 Working Group I (WG1) concluded that well-mixed greenhouse gases were “very likely the main driver of tropospheric warming since 1979” [1]. However, Chapter 7 of the IPCC AR6 WG1 Contribution did not take into proper consideration the observed increase of solar radiation absorption by Earth in recent decades known as “global brightening” [2] (Section 7.2.2.3). The Report did not analyze the decrease of Earth’s shortwave reflectance evident in the CERES EBAF dataset over the past 20 years and its impact on GSAT. Published studies agree that the observed decrease of planetary albedo and the associated increase of solar-energy uptake by the planet must have had a significant impact on the global temperature. However, there has been no attempts thus far to quantify the actual effect of this solar forcing on GSAT. We tried to bridge this knowledge gap by developing a novel, non-statistical process model from First Principles that explicitly relates changes in TSI and albedo to global temperature anomalies. The model (Equation (16)) was derived from independent NASA planetary observations and basic rules of calculus without using Earth-specific data, greenhouse-gas radiative forcing, or positive (amplifying) feedbacks. Our goal was to verify the above IPCC AR6 conclusion by assessing the direct effect of measured changes in TSI and Earth’s sunlight absorption on the 21st-century global surface warming as documented by 6 temperature datasets.

Our analysis revealed that the solar forcing (i.e., TSI and albedo changes) measured by CERES explain 100% of the observed global warming trend and 83% of the interannual GSAT variability over the past 24 years (Figure 9), including the extreme 2023 heat anomaly (Figure 10). Albedo changes were found to be by far the dominant GSAT driver, while TSI variations only played a minor, modulating role (Figure 11 and Figure 12). The sustained increase of sunlight absorption by the planet was also identified as the most likely driver of ocean warming in recent decades based on a high correlation (R2 = 0.8) between the shortwave radiation uptake and the mean annual temperature anomaly of the 0–100 m global oceanic layer (Figure 8). These results suggest a lack of physical reality to both the anthropogenic radiative forcing attributed to rising greenhouse gases and the positive (amplifying) feedbacks hypothesized by the greenhouse theory and simulated by climate models. This is because any real forcing (or amplifying feedback) outside of the increased planetary uptake of solar radiation would have produced additional warming above and beyond the amount explained by changes in the planetary albedo and TSI. However, no such extra warming is observed in the available temperature records. Hence, the anthropogenic radiative forcing and associated positive feedbacks are likely model artifacts rather than real phenomena. The empirical data and model calculations analyzed in our study also indicate that the Earth’s climate sensitivity to radiative forcing is only 0.29–0.30 K/(W m−2). Therefore, the greenhouse theory overestimates this parameter by 56–158%.

The lack of evidence for heat trapping by greenhouse gases in the climate system during the 21st Century raises an important question about the physical nature of the Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI). The latter is defined as the difference between the absorbed shortwave and outgoing LW flux at the TOA. EEI has been observed and calculated by various monitoring platforms for several decades. This index became a research focus in climate science during the past 15 years, because it has been perceived as evidence of anthropogenic heat accumulation (energy retention) in the Earth system that would commit the World to a prolonged future warming, even after human carbon emissions have reached a net-zero level. As a result of such a view, EEI is now called the “most fundamental indicator for climate change” [33]. However, our analysis of observed data, model calculations, and standard thermodynamic theory showed that EEI has been misinterpreted by the science community, since it arises from adiabatic dissipation of thermal energy in ascending air parcels in the troposphere due to a decreasing atmospheric pressure with height (see discussion in Section 4). Hence, integrating EEI over space and time in an effort to calculate some total “energy gain” by the Earth system, as done by researchers in recent years, is physically misleading, because EEI includes energy that was adiabatically lost to the system during the convective cooling process. Our analyses also showed that this energy imbalance results from a varying sunlight absorption by the planet and would only disappear if the Earth’s albedo stops changing and the uptake of shortwave radiation stabilizes, which is unlikely to ever occur. The reduction of human greenhouse-gas emissions cannot and will not affect EEI. Nevertheless, the Earth has gained a considerable amount of thermal energy over the past 45 years due to a sustained increase of shortwave-radiation uptake, which is a completely different mechanism from the theorized trapping of radiant heat by greenhouse gases, since it does not involve a hidden energy storage.",4,89,2024-08-20 17:16:45,en,climatechange

1exj88g,"Why is one of the easiest changes regarding climate change being ignored and another simple, but very expensive solution?","A simple solution to drastically reduce climate change is to increase the planet's overall reflection. How can we do that? By simply painting whatever we can white and avoid especially darker colors...

The majority of cars have darker colors. Even if their exterior is white the interior is always darker than white and sun always gets inside.

I know that many people hate white and it's obvious why - too easy to see dirt/spots on it and in general it's not a stylish color like black (<3), but if our future well being depends on it I find it a dumb excuse. Why are new cars not charged extra CO2 credits when they are not in white color and contribute more to the global warming instead of brighter cars? I don't have a car, but if I had a choice I wouldn't mind it being white and having more comfort in the summer days.

Not only that but having everything white would make interior buildings cooler as well, so it's a general convenience to everyone! It would reduce the electricity bills too.

A very expensive solution to global warming is to launch a space mirror or construct it in space. It doesn't have to be huge. It just needs to be close to the sun to cast a major shadow on our planet. A clever way would be to have multiple smaller mirrors in order not to impact the climate and nature too much. This should be far bigger priority than the silly Mars colonization of Elon Musk!

According to researches mentioned here [https://www.kold.com/story/17738111/white-versus-black-roofs-a-big-temperature-difference/](https://www.kold.com/story/17738111/white-versus-black-roofs-a-big-temperature-difference/) the difference could be around 30 degrees Celsium for black roofs alone.

1evk6ge,"Another Outer Banks Home Collapses Into Ocean, a Stark Reminder of Climate Change","In Rodanthe, N.C., seven homes have been lost to the ocean in the last four years, as rising sea levels erode shorelines and put more buildings at risk.


In North Carolina, climate change has caused the sea level to rise by about half a foot since 2000, and the level could rise by about another foot by 2050, said William Sweet, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.


Rodanthe, located on Hatteras Island, is home to many oceanfront properties with elevated houses sitting on pilings that were once surrounded by dunes and dry sand. Now, that land is often partially or fully covered by water, which erodes the sand around the pilings that support the homes, creating the risk of a collapse.


Officials said that residents facing the threat of home collapse have limited — and largely unappealing — options.

They can move their home to drier ground, a costly and logistically complicated process that is not always feasible. They can pay to have their home demolished. Or, they can wait until the home collapses and then seek reimbursement through insurance, if covered.

1ev5i74," ""NOAA: July 2024 was Earth’s hottest month on record
A stunning streak of global record warmth is now 14 months long, according to the agency;""  ""not a lot of difference in Atlantic hurricane activity between La Niña and neutral conditions""","[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/08/noaa-july-2024-was-earths-hottest-month-on-record/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/08/noaa-july-2024-was-earths-hottest-month-on-record/)

Jeff Masters and Bob Henson are two of the nation's leading hurricane experts.

Buried in the article is a significant observation that was news to me:

<<El Niño conditions tend to suppress Atlantic hurricane activity through an increase in wind shear, but La Niña conditions tend to have the opposite effect. There’s not a lot of difference in Atlantic hurricane activity between La Niña and neutral conditions.>>

The first sentence is common knowledge for individuals who follow hurricane projections.  I've never before seen, to my memory, the observation in the second sentence.

A forecast emergence of La Nina conditions, along with record ocean heat content, has formed the basis for forecasts of at least a near record hurricane season in 2024, as explained in this recently updated NOAA 2024 hurricane season forecast.

<<Highly active hurricane season likely to continue in the Atlantic

Near-record sea surface temperatures and the possibility of La Nina are key factors>>

[https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/highly-active-hurricane-season-likely-to-continue-in-atlantic](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/highly-active-hurricane-season-likely-to-continue-in-atlantic)

The failure of La Nina conditions to emerge perhaps have led some to believe that the expected severe hurricane season for 2024 might be avoided.  The NOAA recently revised hurricane forecast for a severe hurricane season is little changed from its initial May forecast, despite the failure of La Nina conditions to yet emerge.  The NOAA revised forecast didn't specifically address the critical point that neutral ENSO (see link at end of post) conditions, already in effect, aren't much different than La Nina conditions in impacting hurricane development.

If Masters and Henson are correct, which would appear highly likely given their expertise and the failure of NOAA to condition its revised forecast on the emergence of La Nina conditions, that there is ""not a lot of difference in Atlantic hurricane activity between La Nina and neutral conditions,"" it would appear the next few months may yet experience severe hurricane activity in hurricane-prone regions of the U.S.

A key observation buried in the revised NOAA hurricane forecast:

<<Of note, the dry Saharan air that prevented tropical storm development during portions of the middle of the summer is expected to subside in August. >>

[https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/highly-active-hurricane-season-likely-to-continue-in-atlantic](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/highly-active-hurricane-season-likely-to-continue-in-atlantic)

Masters and Henson discuss current ENSO forecasts in their July heat report:

<<The 2023-24 [El Niño event](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2023/12/how-will-el-nino-affect-the-u-s-this-winter/) in the Eastern Pacific ended during May, and neutral conditions are now in place, NOAA reported in its latest [monthly discussion](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.shtml) of the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. La Niña is still projected to prevail during 2024-25, but the slower-than-expected pace of development thus far has chipped away slightly at the probabilities in the most recent forecasts.

According to the official NOAA probabilistic forecast [issued August 8](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/figure07.gif), which is based on expert judgment drawing from observations and model data, there is now a 50% chance of La Niña conditions developing by August-September-October. These odds are down from the 70% odds for the same period given in the forecast issued in July.>>

[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/08/noaa-july-2024-was-earths-hottest-month-on-record/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/08/noaa-july-2024-was-earths-hottest-month-on-record/)

From a May 31 Masters and Henson article analyzing the 2024 hurricane season outlook:

<<**Bob:** I would submit also perhaps a better-than-usual chance of a late hurricane with La Niña conditions really settling in. La Niña years can often have some really bad late hurricanes. 

**Jeff:** That’s a good point. The end of the season could be more active than the early part of the season in that regard.

**Bob:** That was the case in 2020, when we went all the way into the supplementary names.>>

[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/05/jeff-masters-and-bob-henson-give-us-the-low-down-on-the-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/05/jeff-masters-and-bob-henson-give-us-the-low-down-on-the-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season/)

If La Nina and neutral ENSO conditions don't impact hurricane formation much differently, are La Nina conditions necessary to fulfill this forecast of late season hurricane activity?

1eua9lk,I am worried about my future.,"Idk if this will get aproved or not, I just want to take some weight out of my body. I will probably delete this account in a week or so.

I am a young person (19yo) from Argentina who lived in a middle sized city 17 years of my life, and I am deeply worried. I just started reading deeply (at least that's what I guess) about CC around a month ago and I feel very hopeless, perhaps desperate, perhaps distressed, Idk, I watched some James Hansen paper presentations, reading a bit about Simon Michaux, heard the interview that Nate Hansen did to William Rees, read some articles of the LtG paper and it's updates, read some presentations about MIT books. All of those things built up the stress in my body regarding the possble collapse of Modern Human Civilization and I don't know what to do. I talked to my psychologist about this and she told me to stop reading so many negative news, that it's just the media that's trying to get people to read them for ads. Idk if that's true when I am the one actively seeking them out.

I study physics in part thanks to sci-fi and my grandfather. He is a massive fan of space, UFOs, physics and Carl Sagan, always telling me about how intelligent and wise he was. How he dreamed about this massive space exploration and settlement ideas, how he and his team convinced the USA and USSR from not destroying the world with nukes. The idea of a galaxy rise. I felt sad and hopeless when I saw his speech in the 80s in front of the US congress talking about climate change and Assimov's speech in American Humanist Association. If the smartest and wisest people I know of couldn't convince the world to do something, who could?

After this month I was left looking through many subs and interviews a sort of light at the end of the tunnel. Nothing, at least in my view. Some coments and questions I have read: 

-""If society were to collapse, would we return to our current prosperity and technological levels at some point?"" A: ""No because we have mined all easy access ores and energy sources in this planet so you wouldn't unless you have the required technologies and energy which you won't get anyway because of lowering EROI""

-""At least after the extinction of humanity the planet will recover"". 

-""Oh well, humanity was always a plage/cancer cell/parasite/plague to the planet anyway""

-""You are living in the end of the high prosperity times. Enjoy it while it lasts""

I feel like I can't accept this coments because of how many good people I have met and made friends with. How many of them are alive thanks to modern medicine. Even when I went to college in a big city, the people there helped me and guided me. Where to go, where not to go, what to do, how it's done and so on. All of that made me have faith in humanity and it's empathy. Am I just doomed to see them and myself die if society collpases? Because let's be honest, at least me, I don't have any of the skills, tools nor emotions to survive such scenario, I would most likely curl in a ball and die at some point.

I could always turn around and see the progress we have made so far but I honestly don't want to fool myself because at least in my college, if you have a score of 1/10 in a test it's called **insufficient**. Having a president and an appointed head of the national science comission say that climate change isn't real doesn't makes me more relaxed. Neither does the fact that many of the people I listed are not talking about whether people somewhere will suffer or not but rather about whether we will survive or not. My obsession problem has reached a point where I can even identiify certain ""doomer"" users and actively avoid reading their comments because I don't want to be even more burried in sadness.

I am no man for politics. Yes, I had my phase where I tried to get into it and swinged between ideologies as fast as the ""I am 16 and I want to get into politics"" video until falling back into undesided but even in that phase, when I saw kids and adults march and discuss about politics, I just shruged and thought ""that's for the adults to do. Like voting, drinking and marring today"". So Idk what to do. I am trying to reduce meat consumption to as low as I reasonably can for a person with no education in nutrition and I talked to my father about Climate Change. Funnily enough, he just shruged the same way I did and said something along the lines of: ""We can't know everything in the world, much less worry. That's why we have specialists. To listen to their recomendations and follow their orders"". So yeah, that's all. Thanks for reading if you did.",112,190,2024-08-17 01:29:45,en,climatechange

1ev5kin,Forests are not carbon sinks.,"Why are forests carbon sinks? We’ve been told repeatedly as children that forests are carbon sinks. It made sense back in 6th grade because trees spit out less carbon dioxide than they take in. But that carbon has to go somewhere, no? Either into the soil or into the tree. Given this, it would make sense that even for a singular tree, its carbon emissions would approach its storage rate as the tree grows older and its growth rate slows. We’re also forgetting that trees die. When a tree dies in an established forest, that carbon has to go somewhere. Either into the soil or into the atmosphere through the decomposition process. My point is that if old growth forests were carbon sinks, we would see them increase in size over time or the carbon in the system would increase (more c in soil, more squirrels over time, etc). But what we see is a dynamic equilibrium. No matter what happens, there’s some negative feedback in the system that accounts for it.  That’s what makes these forests “old growth”. I want to be wrong, but I don’t know what I’m missing. The only semi dangerous assumption I seem to be making is that these ecosystems don’t change slowly over millennia.

1etyq7t,Why is increased CO2 emission bad if the atmosphere is already opaque...,"Atmospheric absorption charts I have seen seem to say that the atmosphere is already opaque at most of the infrared absorption wavelengths for CO2: 2.7 microns, 4.25, 14-15, but not for 2 microns (and the 2 micron wavelength seems to me to reradiate more from the sun than the earth, so net cooling). So why do climate scientists say we need to reduce our CO2 emissions? Why would more CO2 cause more greenhouse heating if the atmosphere is already opaque?  I assume temperature is rising due to earth's present energy imbalance at recent decades' level of CO2 and methane... that we're not at steady state yet. I don't see that more CO2 changes the final steady state.

  
Is it that more CO2 means higher concentration in the lower atmosphere and this increases heating even if the air column is opaque?

  
I am not a climate denier. I am an engineer trying to understand enough to discuss with a friend and I don't want to say anything obviously stupid and easily shot down.

I understand that CO2 stays in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years.

  
I understand we should reduce methane emissions and that the atmosphere is not opaque at methane's wavelength.

  
Thank you in advance.

While that's good, I started thinking...I'm assuming that lithium factories are embedded in supply chains, and so any new kid on the block would have to usurp its position.

How long does anyone think that'll take? Given that there are a few different technologies available at present, I can foresee a VHS v Betamax-type battle over which would be the technology everyone adopted.

I’ve been diving into some research on systemic change and how we can tackle big issues like climate change and inequality. There are some fascinating initiatives out there that are trying to make a real difference, so far I found these interesting but I’d like to get to know more (found these mostly on linkedin).

* **The Transition Towns movement** (https://transitionnetwork.org/): This initiative focuses on building stronger, more resilient communities. I love how it emphasizes local action and community resilience, which feels really empowering.
* **The Ellen MacArthur Foundation** (https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/): They are pushing for a circular economy to reduce waste and make better use of resources. The idea of designing out waste and keeping products in use is something that really resonates with me.
* **The Green Standard Trust** (https://www.gstdao.com): This seems to be a new kind of land trust that combines capitalism with philanthropy by backing cryptocurrency with land. It seems like a unique way to rethink how we value our planet and sounds bold! I’m intrigued by how this could potentially align economic incentives with environmental preservation.
* **The B Corporation movement** (https://www.bcorporation.net): They certify companies that meet high social and environmental standards. I appreciate how this movement is transforming the business landscape by holding companies accountable to higher standards.
* **The Green New Deal** (https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal\_en): This is a big policy proposal aimed at tackling climate change and economic inequality together. The comprehensive approach of addressing multiple issues at once is something I find very promising.

1enha3v,CO2 in Oceans - critical factor?,"In discussions here, I continually wonder why CO2 dissolved in ocean waters isn't discussed more.  There is 60x more CO2 there than in the atmosphere, and some sources estimate even more than in all known fossil fuel deposits.

One angle is a concern of acidifying the oceans via carbonic acid.  Were all atmospheric CO2 today to be dissolved, it could increase ocean CO2 by <2%.  Could that appreciably affect acidity?  Would it hurt or help coral?  They do need carbon to grow their structure (calcium carbonate).  Much of the CO2 becomes stored in very deep water as pure liquid CO2, so might the dissolved concentration even change?

Ernst-Georg Beck was investigating a relation between atmospheric CO2 and ocean-dissolved CO2.  He thought he found a correlation between ocean events (changes in water temperature and upwelling currents) and atmospheric measurements, just before his early death from cancer.  His papers have largely been ignored by Climate Inc as ""perhaps inconvenient"".  One place to start reading: 

[https://scienceofclimatechange.org/wp-content/uploads/Yndestad-2022-Publication-of-Becks-CO2-series.pdf](https://scienceofclimatechange.org/wp-content/uploads/Yndestad-2022-Publication-of-Becks-CO2-series.pdf)

Some articles and papers which popped up in a quick google below.  I particularly like the discussion in r/askscience where replies applaud the, ""I don't know"" of a true scientist, in contrast to the constant ""what do you believe"" and ""are you a denier"" posted by many here (some notoriously troll my every reply).  The askscience question concerns if adding fresh water to the ocean from ice-melt might absorb additional atmospheric CO2, which is an interesting thought.

My opinion is that much more research in this area would be valuable, as opposed to the continual me-too research papers in journals like Nature Communications which just pile onto the anthropogenic-climate-change claims with no value-added.  But, then I'm not a funding agency.

>From the RGI, we can learn that there are **198,000** glaciers in the World. However, this is a slightly arbitrary quantity, as it depends on the quality of the digital elevation model used, mapping resolution, and the minimum-area threshold used. Most analysts use a minimum area threshold of 0.1 km2; they will not map anything smaller than this due to difficulties in distinguishing between glaciers and snowpacks. If these small glacierets are including, the number of glaciers in the World could be up to 400,000, but they would still only account for 1.4% of the World’s glacierised area.  
      
>Together, these glaciers cover **726,000 km2**.  The region with the most ice is the Antarctic and Subantarctic, with 132,900 km2, closely followed by Arctic Canada North (104,900 km2). At the other end of the scale, New Zealand has only 1160 km2 of ice. In total, 44% of the World’s glacierised area is in the Arctic regions, and 18% is in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Glaciers cover 0.5% of the Earth’s land surface13.

> ... the Antarctic Ice Sheet covers almost 14 million square kilometers (5.4 million square miles), roughly the area of the contiguous United States and Mexico combined. The Antarctic Ice Sheet measures nearly 4.9 kilometers (3 miles) at its thickest point and contains about 30 million cubic kilometers (7.2 million cubic miles) of ice. If the entire Antarctic Ice Sheet melted, sea level would rise about 58 meters (190 feet).

At its thickest point, the Greenland Ice Sheet measures over 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) thick and contains about 2.9 million cubic kilometers (696,000 cubic miles) of ice.

Most people i talk to say something along the lines of ""we've always figured it out and we always will."" They are failing to meet their own climate goals, failing to reduce their cow situationship (no other word for it really if we're being honest haaa). I am not aware of a settled plan/strategy for sea level rise, only 4 different"" options ""closed, open, advance, and accommodate"". But i havent heard of a commitment to a plan or action taken towards it. 

Meanwhile, there's also a massive housing crisis. Homes are getting more and more expensive. Even as the ocean rises. This seems to have zero impact on the housing market somehow. 

My family wants/needs a bigger house, but i hesitate to dump so much of our net worth into an asset that seems.... Possibly inevitability going to be literally under water. Yet, we love living among the Randstad canals...... 

Does anyone have any insights into how to think about all of this? Do the Dutch have a reason i do not see to be so comfortable and to be apparently taking their time? Is there any holistic argument to justify or rule out tieing my family's financial future to a beautiful canal-side property?

1eft7tc,Does Gulf Stream collapse nullify global warming for Europe?,"I keep reading that a collapse of the Gulf Stream will put Europe in an ice age. However, at the same time, average temperatures have been rising very fast in Europe, faster than the rest of the world. How will these two phenomena work in parallel? Does Europe net get colder or hotter after Gulf Stream collapse or do they cancel out?

Also if Europe does go into an ice age, wouldn't that bring the polar ice caps back? Could that lead to a feedback loop that cools the Earth as a whole, not just Europe?

We will still use trucks to carry cargo from the train station to their final destination. We can even electrify railways to further reduce emissions, assuming we use carbon free electricity. Secondly we will make electricity generation carbon free, we will use nuclear and renewable energy to achieve this. Thirdly we will decarbonize industries by electrifying light and medium industries and use green hydrogen for heavy industry. Fourthly we will stop deforestation and reforest deforestated areas. Fifthly we can make public transport more widely avaliable and used. All countries keep using fossil fuels for cars, trucks, trains, ships and airplanes.

1edk91v,"The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 900 pg pdf ""Mandate for Leadership"" quotes about climate change and the deregulation of the EPA","Here are the quotes from ""Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise"" that might concern environmentalists, along with page numbers, explanations and potential issues:

1. **Back to Basics in the EPA**:
   - **Quote**: ""EPA’s structure and mission should be greatly circumscribed to reflect the principles of cooperative federalism and limited government. This will require significant restructuring and streamlining of the agency... EPA should build earnest relationships with state and local officials and assume a more supportive role by sharing resources and expertise, recognizing that the primary role in making choices about the environment belongs to the people who live in it.""
   - **Page**: 420
   - **Explanation**: This approach suggests a reduction in the EPA's regulatory authority, shifting more responsibility to state and local governments. Historically, federal oversight has been crucial in maintaining consistent environmental standards across states, preventing a ""race to the bottom"" where states might lower standards to attract business. Reducing federal oversight could lead to less stringent environmental protections, potentially increasing pollution and environmental degradation.

2. **Reduction in EPA’s Size and Scope**:
   - **Quote**: ""Cutting EPA’s size and scope will deliver savings to the American taxpayer. Improved transparency will serve as an important check to ensure that the agency’s mission is not distorted or coopted for political gain.""
   - **Page**: 446
   - **Explanation**: The proposal to reduce the EPA's size could lead to fewer resources and less capacity to enforce environmental laws. Historically, cuts to environmental enforcement have often led to increased pollution incidents and reduced compliance with environmental regulations. This could particularly impact communities already burdened by pollution.

3. **Critical View of the EPA’s Climate Agenda**:
   - **Quote**: ""Embedded activists have sought to evade legal restraints in pursuit of a global, climate-themed agenda... The EPA under the Biden Administration has returned to the same top-down, coercive approach that defined the Obama Administration. There has been a reinstitution of unachievable standards designed to aid in the 'transition' away from politically disfavored industries and technologies and toward the Biden Administration’s preferred alternatives.""
   - **Page**: 418-419
   - **Explanation**: This criticism suggests a move away from stringent climate regulations. Historically, environmental regulations have played a crucial role in reducing emissions and mitigating climate change. Loosening these regulations could lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and hinder efforts to address global warming, exacerbating environmental problems.

4. **Energy Sector Policies**:
   - **Quote**: ""Opposition from 'Keep it in the ground' environmentalists has made it harder to gain approvals for natural gas pipelines. Under Democrat leadership, FERC has proposed official policies to consider upstream and downstream GHG emissions from the use of the natural gas that would be shipped in the pipeline to be part of FERC’s public-interest determination when deciding whether to approve a pipeline.""
   - **Page**: 407
   - **Explanation**: The resistance to considering full lifecycle emissions in pipeline approvals could lead to underestimating the environmental impact of fossil fuel infrastructure. This could result in more projects that contribute significantly to climate change being approved, counteracting efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

5. **Critique of the Biden Administration’s Environmental Policies**:
   - **Quote**: ""As a consequence of this approach, we see the return of costly, job-killing regulations that serve to depress the economy and grow the bureaucracy but do little to address, much less resolve, complex environmental problems.""
   - **Page**: 418
   - **Explanation**: Labeling environmental regulations as ""job-killing"" and bureaucratic could justify rolling back crucial protections. Historically, such rollbacks have led to increased pollution and public health issues. The focus on economic costs without addressing the long-term benefits of environmental regulations could undermine efforts to safeguard public health and ecosystems.

These quotes highlight a shift towards reducing federal environmental oversight and regulation, emphasizing economic concerns over environmental protections. This approach could lead to weakened environmental standards, potentially exacerbating pollution and climate change issues. Historically, federal environmental regulations have played a crucial role in preventing pollution and protecting public health, and reductions in these areas have often led to increased environmental degradation and health risks.

Apparently, long-term global warming trends and long-term heatwave trends are causing heatwaves in the United States and many other countries to become increasingly more frequent, increasingly more intense (hotter), and increasingly longer lasting, while the long-term trend seems to indicate that the season of summertime temperatures is arriving increasingly earlier in the year and is ending increasingly later in the year, with global average summertime temperatures rising increasingly higher each year.    
         
At the same time, the long-term trend seems to indicate that the season of wintertime temperatures is arriving increasingly later in the year and is ending increasingly earlier in the year.

1ecbd8c,Observed humidity trends in dry regions contradict climate models,"Recent studies, including one published in PNAS, have highlighted a significant discrepancy between climate model predictions and actual observations of atmospheric water vapor in arid and semi-arid regions. According to the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship, a warmer atmosphere should hold more moisture, leading models to predict an increase in water vapor even in dry areas. However, observations over the past four decades show that near-surface water vapor has remained constant or even declined in these regions.

What could be causing this discrepancy? It seems very odd to me, even after the limited explanation in the articles. Are there known factors that models might be missing or misrepresenting, particularly regarding moisture availability or atmospheric circulation patterns?

1eb7ous,"Suppose we ""Electrify Everything!"" What % of our current greenhouse gas emissions would still remain?","Suppose, magically, that we somehow were to electrify all power, all transportation (including aviation), and all residential, office, and industrial heat via renewable energy (i.e. the idea of ""Electrify Everything!"") tomorrow. What percentage of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of our current total would still remain?

Electrify Everything won't solve all the climate issues. That is, it won't shrink our GHG emissions down to 0.

For instance, consider cement. From what I have read, cement production is responsible for about 8% of global emissions. Part of the emissions in producing cement comes from industrial heat, namely, about 40% of cement's emissions. THAT part would go away if we were to electrify the heat with renewables somehow. But the remaining 60% of emissions from producing cement comes from the chemical process itself, in which CO2 is released as a chemical byproduct when limestone is turned into calcium oxide. So, just from cement alone, that is nearly 5% of global GHG emissions that would remain even if we electrify everything.

Or take agriculture. Cattle burps/farts release methane. I've seen estimates that this methane constitutes 4% of global GHGs. Then there is nitrous oxide produced by soil microbes acting on synthetic fertilizer spread on crops (about half of which goes unused by the crops). I've seen estimates that this nitrous oxide from fertilizers is around 3% of global GHGs. Electrifying everything won't reduce methane from cattle or nitrous oxide from excess fertilizer.

So, already with just cement, cows, and fertilizer, that is 12% of global emissions that would be wholly untouched even by a vastly successful Electrify Everything strategy. And that 12%  does not include the effects of deforestation, permafrost methane, plastics production, the industrial production of other chemicals, etc.

**Has anyone tried to put a number on what percentage of GHG emissions would still remain even if we electrify all power, transportation, and heat with renewables?**

20%? 25%? 30%?

In short, how much of our climate problem would Electrify Everything solve?

(Don't get me wrong. I'm a fan of using renewable energy to electrify as much as we can. I'm just curious how much warming will be left even if we are wildly successful with electrification.)

**EDIT:** Reddit user cybercuzco below posts a link to a World in Data chart that (as best I can tell) seems to be what I am after: https://ourworldindata.org/ghg-emissions-by-sector. If that is right, this suggests the answer to my question is that a massively successful Electrify Everything transition would (holding all else constant) eliminate around 73% of our GHG emissions and thus leave 27% of emissions unabated.",72,72,2024-07-24 13:45:44,en,climatechange

Recently I have become interested in trying to essentially debunk more ‘new age’ climate denialism. A recent report was published on it which triggered this interest and in particular how to respond to people who make claims which on the surface seem less harmful but are actually, simply just denialism. For example, ‘Scientists have been telling us that our planet is going to die for the past 70 years, it hasn’t happened yet’ or ‘I have looked at the data; I don’t think this is a human based problem ’. Whilst I understand that most of these people can’t be reasoned with, in a world which is literally burning in front of us I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on this topic.",33,157,2024-07-23 21:03:33,en,climatechange

1eahfmc,Methane vs CO2 -- a question.,"Methane traps more much heat than CO2; it is a much more potent greenhouse gas (GHG). But methane stays in the atmosphere much less time than CO2 does. From what I have read, methane that is released now will stay around 12 years in the atmosphere. By contrast, CO2 released now will last for much longer, namely, at least hundreds of years.

How should we weigh these different variables (namely, potency vs longevity) against each other, to get some sense of how harmful each gas overall is in terms of warming?

**For instance, suppose we could wave a magic wand and either remove 1 ton of CO2 or remove 1 ton of methane from the atmosphere. Which gas should we choose?**

If we remove methane, then we are removing the stronger GHG. That seems good! On the other hand, we are removing just 12 years worth of warming. If we remove CO2, however, we are removing hundreds of years of warming. That seems good too!

Is there a ""lifetime warming"" quantity that can be calculated for each of these tons, i.e. for CO2 and for methane? If so, then we could say, ""Let's remove the ton with the lower lifetime warming quantity."" Has this calculation been done? If so, which gas has the lower lifetime warming quantity?

(Of course, if we as a planet are near some or other tipping point within a decade or so, then it could make sense to remove the methane even if it has a lower lifetime warming effect. It could make sense to do tha tin order to prevent methane's potency -- albeit its shorter-term potency -- from pushing us over some threshold and into a harmful tipping point scenario. My guess is that that consideration might be decisive in favor of removing the 1 ton of methane instead of the 1 ton of CO2.)

*Side note 1:* I see various estimates for the longevity of atmospheric CO2. E.g. NASA says 300 to 1000 years. Other sites just say ""hundreds to thousands of years."" Why so imprecise? Do we not know CO2's longevity in the atmosphere? Or is it complicated by other factors/complexities, so that ""It depends"" is the only fair answer?

*Side note 2:* Of course, the same question (""Remove this or CO2?"") could be asked of nitrous oxide, not just methane. From what I have read, though, nitrous oxide is apparently much more potent than CO2 AND quite long-lived as well (unlike methane). So it seems an easier question, whether to remove 1 ton of CO2 or 1 ton of nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide, I assume! Even more so with fluorinated gases vs CO2. Hence, my focus in this post on methane in particular.",6,14,2024-07-23 15:59:18,en,climatechange

1ea495i," The Impact of Climate and CO2 on Flora, Fauna, and Energy","Vegetation does not grow in the extreme colds found at the North and South Poles. The only wildlife that can survive in these climates relies on consuming marine life, which requires temperatures high enough to maintain liquid water. The greatest flora and fauna diversity on Earth exists in the tropics, which are the warmest and wettest non-marine environments on the planet. Increasing CO2 levels reduce the water requirements for all flora, increasing yield and available nutrition for all fauna, even in desert environments.

Heat is energy. A colder planet would not only increase global power demands, as heating homes is more energy-intensive than cooling, but would also reduce the available energy to heat homes. Heat can be turned into electricity in several ways, such as with a thermoelectric generator. Solar panels lose efficiency in colder environments, and battery performance declines in lower temperatures. Hydroelectric power obviously needs warm enough environments to keep water liquid, but it is aided by the precipitation of liquid water, which decreases when temperatures fall.

Carbon only makes up 0.025% of the Earth’s crust, while CO2 accounts for only 0.04% of the atmosphere (\~418 ppm). This means that out of roughly 2,392 molecules of air, there is just 1 molecule of CO2, and yet people think that’s too much. Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which is why ice cores drilled for historical CO2 levels will always show extremely low and consistent amounts. When water freezes, it always does so from the outer layer inward, sealing off atmospheric CO2 from getting in. CO2 is also a result of some aerobic reactions, which only take place where there is heat above the freezing point of liquid water.

Regardless of these facts, we can engineer solutions to address the challenges of global warming. However, when it comes to global cooling, there is little we can do except burn fuel and use nuclear energy.",0,6,2024-07-23 06:15:53,en,climatechange

EDIT:  Several of the comments reinforce my point.  A majority of Americans, as evidenced by the lack of concern among politicians and media, don't seem to understand the gravity of climate change impacts on the environment, living things, and certainly mankind.  E.g., a decline in the bird population will likely increase insect populations, negatively impacting among a host of things, agricultural production unless pesticide use increases greatly.

Saw this article just recently, and wondered whether the decline in the bird population also was a factor, although much warmer winters clearly is reducing winter kill-offs of insects.

<<McDermott says the dramatic rise of tick-borne diseases in Ohio is happening for a combination of reasons.

First, there are more ticks in the state.

Because of factors like climate change and reforestation, Ohio has more habitat for ticks than it did just a few decades ago. As a result, ticks are thriving here, McDermott said.

“Ohio is really on the forefront of tick expansion,” he said. “We went from one tick of medical importance to humans, companion animals and livestock 20 years ago, which was the American dog tick, to five nowadays, including adding two new ticks in just the last few years.”

Plus, a lot of those ticks are carrying diseases.>>

1e6u6he,Benefits of getting solar power panels,"Is it just me or does getting solar panels for a home sound like it will be a good idea going forward?  I'm not trying to sell solar power to anyone but I was thinking about it the other day and going, ""why aren't more people doing this?""  It's really strange because here are the pros that I can see:

* It will drive down fossil fuel use at the grid level, even if on a small, household scale
* Air conditioners will be cheaper to run on solar generated electricity
   * And the hotter it gets the more people will rely on AC in the future, making AC use probably one of the biggest expenses in electrical use going forward
* There are plenty of rebates, tax credits, and financing options
* The electrical bill won't be as high and/or as variable, and a flat, monthly financing payment would probably take its place 
* People could recharge their cars using solar-generated electricity if they chose to get an EV, which seems to be the trend

The only downsides seem to be economical/logistical

* It's a long term commitment to break even, savings wise
* They're usually more expensive out of pocket than most people can afford, which means people would probably have to finance them
* People would have to know if they're going to live in the same house over the long term if they finance solar panels
* Some people live in areas with lots of shade and not much direct sunlight

But even in the short term, just the electric bill alone would be worth it, imo.  There are companies that do ""no cost"" solar where you pay a flat monthly rate to basically ""borrow"" panels from companies who use the government incentives for themselves.

I recently stumbled upon an insightful blog post by SG Analytics on how carbon offsetting can play a crucial role in combating climate change. For anyone interested in sustainability and environmental solutions, this is a must-read! 🌱

The article breaks down the concept of carbon offsetting in a very digestible way. It covers how companies and individuals can balance their carbon emissions by investing in projects that reduce or remove CO2 from the atmosphere. From reforestation initiatives to renewable energy projects, it’s fascinating to see the various ways we can contribute to a greener planet.

One point that really resonated with me was the emphasis on transparency and effectiveness in carbon offset programs. It’s not just about planting trees; it’s about ensuring these projects have a genuine, measurable impact. The blog also touches on some common misconceptions and challenges in the carbon offsetting space, which I found super enlightening.

If you’re passionate about climate change and looking for actionable ways to make a difference, I highly recommend giving this a read: [How Carbon Offsetting Can Fight Against Climate Change](https://us.sganalytics.com/blog/how-carbon-offsetting-can-fight-against-climate-change/).

This weekend is[ International Passive House Open Days](https://passivehousenetwork.org/featured/open-days-june-24/), a global celebration of energy-efficient, sustainable building that truly makes a difference in a world where 40% of emissions come from the building sector. We have 25 Passive House buildings that are opening their doors in the US and even more internationally.

We've been working to encourage jurisdictions to adopt better building codes to mitigate emissions, and this is a great chance to show people in your area how energy-efficient buildings can still prioritize occupant comfort. We encourage you to find a location near you, bring a friend, and make connections in your community!

Cambridge researchers may have a new adage thanks to an ingenious method that can apparently make cleaner cement as part of the steelmaking process. 

As a result, it seems that two dirty materials can make a clean one. 

While the would-be proverb isn't quite on par with offerings from [Confucious](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Confucius), the science behind the breakthrough could revolutionize manufacturing in the building sector. It's widely reported that the cement and steelmaking industries make up about [8%](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24062022/concrete-is-worse-for-the-climate-than-flying-why-arent-more-people-talking-about-it/) and [7%](https://news.asu.edu/20231005-curtailing-unhealthy-impacts-steel-production) of annual global air pollution. 

The Cambridge Electric Cement process begins with concrete waste from demolition of old buildings. This is crushed, to separate the stones and sand that form concrete from the mixture of cement powder and water that bind them together. The old cement powder is then used instead of lime-flux in steel recycling. As the steel melts, the flux forms a slag that floats on the liquid steel, to protect it from oxygen in the air. After the recycled steel is tapped off, the liquid slag is cooled rapidly in air, and ground up into a powder which is virtually identical to the clinker which is the basis of new Portland cement. In pilot-scale trials of the new process, the Cambridge team have demonstrated this combined recycling process, and the results show that it has the chemical composition of a clinker made with today’s process.",48,2,2024-06-24 15:30:26,en,ClimateActionPlan

o Rebates covering 50-100% of the cost of installing new electric appliances, including super-efficient heat pumps, water heaters, clothes dryers, stoves, and ovens

o Rebates for households to make repairs and improvements in single-family and multi-family homes to increase energy efficiency.

o Tax credits covering 30% of the costs to install solar panels and battery storage

systems, make home improvements that reduce energy leakage, or upgrade

heating and cooling equipment. No income limits apply.

o Tax credits covering 30% of the costs of community solar projects—owned by local

businesses that sign up families to save on their electric bills—with additional bonus

credits of 20% for projects at affordable housing properties and 10% for projects in

low-income communities.

o Grants to help state and local governments adopt the latest building energy codes, would save the average new homeowner 29.2%",62,2,2023-08-15 18:44:50,en,ClimateActionPlan

A sleeping duck curve means no excessive solar supply in the middle of the day (thus no curtailment) and power available for the evening, eliminating peak hour. “Across all the modelled scenarios, rooftop solar plus battery trading reduces the 4–8pm wholesale market evening peak by 67–92%.” This will have significant impacts on the revenues of traditional generators.

""Amidst the ongoing conflict and political tension, Russia has managed to achieve a remarkable feat with its **first internationally recognized climate reduction project**, demonstrating the irony of a country making strides in environmentalism while simultaneously engaging in a large-scale military conflict.""

""SIBUR, Russia’s largest petrochemical facility at ZapSibNeftekhim, is the subject of the project which has been certified by Europe's leading validation and verification body, Verico SCE. The project is focused on recycling the by-products of the facility for heat and power generation as well as feeding feedstock residues that cannot be brought back into the core production cycle. This effort will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and has earned SIBUR, Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) totaling **approximately 3 million tones a year**.""

""The Russian move to establish a carbon credit methodology and establish climate reduction projects can be attributed to growing international policies regulating greenhouse gas emissions.""

11m6lzh,USA Festival Aims to become new standard of environmental sustainability,"Hello everyone!

Have you heard about Future Spirit Festival? It's a new music & arts festival near Boston that is running a fundraiser to power as much of their sound/lights/infrastructure off clean energy as possible. Donations go straight into purchasing solar/clean electric generators to run the event.

If the goal is met they are matching 10% of the donations towards a environmental-sustainability-related charity. 

I'm an avid festival goer and this project makes me so happy because I would love to see these life-changing events do a lot better at reducing their carbon emissions and taking better care of attendees / the environment. 

The Kickstarter is at 15% and only has 2 weeks to hit their goal or all of the donations are cancelled. Does anyone here vibe with this message? If so please consider contributing and helping make a momentous movement forward for the Future of Festivals!

1frosay,Some thoughts on the left's justification of extreme measures to save the planet.,"A few recent news stories like [this](https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2024/09/27/just-stop-oil-activists-who-poured-soup-over-vincent-van-goghs-sunflowers-sentenced-to-prison) or [this](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/18/five-just-stop-oil-supporters-jailed-over-protest-that-blocked-m25),  got me thinking, these activists are absolutely convinced that they are acting in good faith to save humanity from itself. 

After a recent rewatch of the movie, I seem to see a lot of parallels between their thinking and that of Thanos in in Avengers: Infinity War. Thanos was convinced that he was destroying half the life in the universe to save the universe. No matter who it hurt, no matter who died, it was justified for the greater good. In the end, his plan was not only cruel but illogical for many reasons, which many Marvel fans have pointed out.

These Just Stop Oil nitwits are following the exact same line of thinking as Thanos. They don’t care that without oil, millions of people worldwide will die. As a modern society we depend on oil for life in so many ways that it is inconceivable that we could continue if it was just shut off.  Tens of millions of people around the world would die, many slowly and suffering great pain.  

But you can’t tell these nitwits this, they have tunnel vison, to them it is worth it to save the planet. Who is responsible for this? We are, we allowed schools and media to teach and prophecy that the world is going to end because of climate change.

Unchallenged headlines like [this](https://www.newsweek.com/newsweek-com-world-ends-tipping-points-climate-change-1751237) have terrified the youth of today. 

The climate doom that has been preached for over fifty years has twisted and warped their perspective. 

What can we do to stop this foolishness?

Now that they updated the data up to 2023, and now all of a sudden the average is 5.6 major hurricanes per decade.

1fn6ozg,Most Climate Policies Are Not Effective in Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions.,"Most Climate Policies Are Not Effective in Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions.



A study published in the “Science” journal found that only 63 of over 1,500 climate policies in 41 countries helped reduce climate-warming emissions.

The study evaluated the policies implemented by the building, electricity, industrial, and transportation sectors in 41 counties and cross-referenced each policy with changes in greenhouse gas emissions.

The 63 effective policies reduced emissions by 0.6-1.8 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. The most successful policy interventions involved a combination of policy tools to influence corporate and consumer behavior.

The study found that policymakers prefer regulations and subsidies to reduce emissions. However, these strategies were not effective.

Policies such as new vehicle taxes, speed limits, and energy-efficient labeling of appliances and cars were also ineffective in reducing emissions.

The most effective policies combine regulations, financial incentives, and taxes.

Christoph Bertram, a professor at the University of Maryland’s Center for Global Sustainability, commented that the study was limited in that it only examined policies that had an impact within two years of implementation.

He said some policies “take longer to make a difference.”One example is the transition from coal to natural gas in the U.S., which began in 2007 and resulted in a 25% reduction in carbon emissions after 15 years.",51,3,2024-09-22 19:26:44,en,climateskeptics

1fjl3im,Scientific American Trashes the “Conceit” of the Arctic Seed Vault ,"The ironically named Scientific American journal heavily criticizes the Arctic Seed Vault operation for daring to adapt to climate change.  Apparently that’s not good enough anymore.  They call for immediate political action to stop climate change.  Anyone attempting to adapt is part of the problem.  All efforts must go to immediate political action.  What does that political action look like?  I think it would look something like this:

1) Seizure of the government under emergency powers and the transition of the republic to an authoritarian eco-state.

2) The immediate shutdown of all fossil fuel industries - refineries, gas stations, power plants.  Everything.  

3) The forced closure of most farms.  Farmers will be bought out or run off their land by green-shirts with guns if need be.

4) Eco-idealogues with enormous centralized powers order a massive effort to replace fossil fuels with renewables and to “reimagine” the farm/food industry into the mass production of insects and bioreactors growing enormous tumors of lab-grown meat.  In a parallel to Mao’s 5 year plans, the efforts are largely corrupted, mismanaged and squandered.  

5) The power grid collapses.  The economy shatters.  Civil unrest explodes.  Society ends.  Mass starvation.  World at war.  Mountains of skulls, etc etc. etc.

Think I’m being dramatic?  Think about this - If these people really believe that the only way to save the world is to stop all activities that produce greenhouse gasses RIGHT NOW, that’s all well and good.  But if they want that then they have to own the consequences.  This is the genocide of all genocides - the extermination of not only one race but the entire human race itself.  This is why they are referred to as “extinctionists”.",53,5,2024-09-18 01:06:39,en,climateskeptics

A research consortium plans to revive geoengineering trials of the controversial iron fertilization technique to pull carbon dioxide from the air, despite public backlash

Scientists plan to seed part of the Pacific Ocean with iron to trigger a surface bloom of phytoplankton that will hopefully suck carbon dioxide out of the air, reviving field trials of a geoengineering technique that has been taboo for more than a decade.

On Sept. 9, 23 academics from Exploring Ocean Iron Solutions (ExOIS), a not-for-profit, noncommercial consortium, laid out a program in Frontiers in Climate to assess iron fertilization. The researchers want to better quantify how much CO2 this technique could sequester in the deep sea and what impacts it might have on marine ecosystems. They hope to start trials across as much as 10,000 square kilometers of the northeastern Pacific Ocean as soon as 2026, says consortium member Ken Buesseler of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says the world will likely need to remove billions of metric tons of atmospheric CO2 to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), and Buesseler says that fertilization could be “one of those pieces in that puzzle.” The ocean already contains much more carbon than Earth’s plants, crops and soils, he says, and it has the capacity to hold far more. Spreading iron, he adds, can “speed up” the natural biological carbon pump by promoting greater phytoplankton growth.

During photosynthesis, phytoplankton consume CO2, sunlight and nutrients, including iron. But in many parts of the ocean, this element is rare. If some is delivered to these areas by windblown dust or volcanic ash—or by a ship deliberately pumping out an iron sulfate solution—a vast number of the microscopic organisms can quickly grow and multiply. When these creatures die or are eaten and excreted by larger ones, some of the carbon that they took up sinks to deep, slow-moving waters as “marine snow,” keeping the carbon out of the atmosphere for decades or centuries.

ExOIS is trying to raise $160 million for the entire program. As a start, the scientists have received a $2-million grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for computer modeling, and they are in talks with potential donors such as the Ocean Resilience and Climate Alliance, a philanthropic coalition funded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg and others.

ExOIS plans to apply to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for permission to conduct trials under the London Protocol, which in 2013 set an international ban on ocean iron fertilization for commercial purposes. The convention allows fertilization for research if it is monitored and doesn’t harm the environment.

Buesseler and others added iron to the ocean during a dozen experiments in the 1990s and 2000s. But a public backlash against tinkering with natural Earth systems arose in 2012, after American entrepreneur Russ George notoriously dumped 100 metric tons of iron dust off the coast of Canada, partly to bolster salmon fishing.

ExOIS promises detailed monitoring of the effects of its field studies, as well as improved computer modeling of the implications. The scientists will add a nonreactive tracer such as sulfur hexafluoride to the iron sulfate solution, a step that will help track the spread of the fertilized water as the iron sulfate slowly breaks down. They will measure CO2 concentrations using ships, floats and underwater drones. And they will check satellite images that can register increases in phytoplankton color at the ocean’s surface. The group is also promising more public engagement and consideration for environmental impacts than were involved in previous iron-spreading projects.

1f9vvmi,SST derived co2 ppm,"What the title says.

  
Apparently this formula gets very close in deriving co2 ppm figures just based on the SST

  
Annual CO₂ increase = 1.964 × UAH-SST + 1.660 (after 1979) Annual CO₂ increase = 2.006 × HAD-SST + 1.143 (after 1959) Annual CO₂ increase = 2.406 × GISS-SST + 0.953 (after 1959)

The Pearson correlations between the predicted CO₂ concentrations and the NOAA measurements for each SST were as follows: UAH-SST (1979～2022) r = 0.9995, P ＜ 4e-64 HAD-SST (1960～2022) r = 0.9995, P ＜ 3e-92 GISS-SST (1960～2022) r = 0.9997, P ＜ 7e-99 Each showed a very strong correlation. The smallest error in 2022 was 1.45 ppm, which was predicted by HAD-SST, based on the analysis of data from the period starting in 1959

1f6o4km,Climate denial vs alarmists,"Frequently I see people refer to climate deniers. I want to point out that climate beliefs are quite complex and people can not be divided into 2 groups, believers and deniers. Some aspects... 

1. Is climate change happening? It is, and always has done for many millions of years. Over the last 600 million years, CO2 has gone from 300ppm to 6000ppm back to 300ppm up to 2000ppm back to 300 ppm again and finally up to 420ppm quite rapidly. Temperature has also varied considerably having been 10 degrees warmer than present and lots colder also. We have recently (about 12,000 years ago) come out of an ice age but we are still in the very cold period as regards the long term. 

2. Are temperature and CO2 correlated? Yes they are, and tend to move up and down together. Over the recent ice age periods it is found that temperature changes PRECEDE CO2 changes by about 800 years. Over recent shorter time periods temperature changes still precede CO2 changes. I know if no research that contradicts this. This is a complex process and many contradictory explanations are given. 

3. Do humans emit large quantities of CO2? Yes, and it has been increasing rapidly over the period of human industrial activity. This is not a contentious area. 

4. How much do humans affect climate change? This is a contentious area and a large number of people believe that they know how to control the climate and that is mainly by reducing fossil fuel use. Three times there have been reductions in fossil fuel use, in the 1970s oil shocks, following the 2008 stock market crash and when covid caused lock downs. So we have an example of how effective reducing fossil fuel use is. It actually has no effect on the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere! Surprisingly, burning less fossil fuels does not even slightly reduce the the rate at which CO2 levels are increasing. 



5. Is global warming happening everywhere? It is happening much more in cities than in the country side. That is because of more tarmac and more also energy use in cities. Every use of fuels produces heat. This is called Urban Heat Island effect. In America it has been estimated that it amounts to 7 F or 4 C. That is many times more than the predicted effects of climate change. So it is very important to get this right. Some studies have shown that separating weather stations into urban and rural gives two averages, one increasing rapidly and the other more or less constant. It is claimed that this effect is removed from weather records. However the adjustments are often done in the opposite direction. 

6. Are disasters happening because of climate change? No, disasters happen because of bad weather events and these have always happened from time to time. Long term records show no trend to more disasters. 

7. Are there any benefits to warming and more CO2? Yes, they cause crops to grow faster and greening of deserts to happen. World wide more people die from the cold than the heat. Most people choose to go to warmer places for their holidays. 

8. Will warming lead to mass extinctions in the near future? No. Most of the species that people say will go extinct have been around for tens of millions of years and already experienced far higher temperatures back then. That is not to say that humans are not causing a mass extinction, because we are. We are wiping out forests and other habitats at an insane rate. In the last 3 decades, there has been a reduction of 90% in insect populations, and that includes bees and other pollinators. That will cause crops to fail and be a major threat to humans.

>If Earth were as far from the sun as Venus, it would receive less radiation and have a colder climate. Earth's distance from the sun allows water to remain liquid, which is important for life. If Earth were farther away from the sun, its oceans would freeze, which would cause them to release less carbon dioxide and vapor. This could lead to a scenario where Earth turns into a hothouse planet similar to Venus, which has a runaway greenhouse effect that causes its oceans to boil away.

The IPCC AR6 Working Group I (WG1) concluded that well-mixed greenhouse gases were “very likely the main driver of tropospheric warming since 1979” [1]. However, Chapter 7 of the IPCC AR6 WG1 Contribution did not take into proper consideration the observed increase of solar radiation absorption by Earth in recent decades known as “global brightening” [2] (Section 7.2.2.3). The Report did not analyze the decrease of Earth’s shortwave reflectance evident in the CERES EBAF dataset over the past 20 years and its impact on GSAT. Published studies agree that the observed decrease of planetary albedo and the associated increase of solar-energy uptake by the planet must have had a significant impact on the global temperature. However, there has been no attempts thus far to quantify the actual effect of this solar forcing on GSAT. We tried to bridge this knowledge gap by developing a novel, non-statistical process model from First Principles that explicitly relates changes in TSI and albedo to global temperature anomalies. The model (Equation (16)) was derived from independent NASA planetary observations and basic rules of calculus without using Earth-specific data, greenhouse-gas radiative forcing, or positive (amplifying) feedbacks. Our goal was to verify the above IPCC AR6 conclusion by assessing the direct effect of measured changes in TSI and Earth’s sunlight absorption on the 21st-century global surface warming as documented by 6 temperature datasets.

Our analysis revealed that the solar forcing (i.e., TSI and albedo changes) measured by CERES explain 100% of the observed global warming trend and 83% of the interannual GSAT variability over the past 24 years (Figure 9), including the extreme 2023 heat anomaly (Figure 10). Albedo changes were found to be by far the dominant GSAT driver, while TSI variations only played a minor, modulating role (Figure 11 and Figure 12). The sustained increase of sunlight absorption by the planet was also identified as the most likely driver of ocean warming in recent decades based on a high correlation (R2 = 0.8) between the shortwave radiation uptake and the mean annual temperature anomaly of the 0–100 m global oceanic layer (Figure 8). These results suggest a lack of physical reality to both the anthropogenic radiative forcing attributed to rising greenhouse gases and the positive (amplifying) feedbacks hypothesized by the greenhouse theory and simulated by climate models. This is because any real forcing (or amplifying feedback) outside of the increased planetary uptake of solar radiation would have produced additional warming above and beyond the amount explained by changes in the planetary albedo and TSI. However, no such extra warming is observed in the available temperature records. Hence, the anthropogenic radiative forcing and associated positive feedbacks are likely model artifacts rather than real phenomena. The empirical data and model calculations analyzed in our study also indicate that the Earth’s climate sensitivity to radiative forcing is only 0.29–0.30 K/(W m−2). Therefore, the greenhouse theory overestimates this parameter by 56–158%.

The lack of evidence for heat trapping by greenhouse gases in the climate system during the 21st Century raises an important question about the physical nature of the Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI). The latter is defined as the difference between the absorbed shortwave and outgoing LW flux at the TOA. EEI has been observed and calculated by various monitoring platforms for several decades. This index became a research focus in climate science during the past 15 years, because it has been perceived as evidence of anthropogenic heat accumulation (energy retention) in the Earth system that would commit the World to a prolonged future warming, even after human carbon emissions have reached a net-zero level. As a result of such a view, EEI is now called the “most fundamental indicator for climate change” [33]. However, our analysis of observed data, model calculations, and standard thermodynamic theory showed that EEI has been misinterpreted by the science community, since it arises from adiabatic dissipation of thermal energy in ascending air parcels in the troposphere due to a decreasing atmospheric pressure with height (see discussion in Section 4). Hence, integrating EEI over space and time in an effort to calculate some total “energy gain” by the Earth system, as done by researchers in recent years, is physically misleading, because EEI includes energy that was adiabatically lost to the system during the convective cooling process. Our analyses also showed that this energy imbalance results from a varying sunlight absorption by the planet and would only disappear if the Earth’s albedo stops changing and the uptake of shortwave radiation stabilizes, which is unlikely to ever occur. The reduction of human greenhouse-gas emissions cannot and will not affect EEI. Nevertheless, the Earth has gained a considerable amount of thermal energy over the past 45 years due to a sustained increase of shortwave-radiation uptake, which is a completely different mechanism from the theorized trapping of radiant heat by greenhouse gases, since it does not involve a hidden energy storage.

These findings call for a fundamental reconsideration of the current paradigm of understanding about climate change and related socio-economic initiatives aimed at drastic reductions of industrial carbon emissions at all costs. An important aspect of this paradigm shift should be the prioritized allocation of funds to support large-scale interdisciplinary research into the physical mechanisms controlling the Earth’s albedo and cloud physics, for these are the real drivers of climate on multidecadal time scales.

The global warming spike at the end is unprecedented, especially so when they can read the temperature in 2100.

Now let's look at this [**graph**.](https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2021/new-method-shows-today.jpg) Nice how the temperatures have barely changed a tenth of a degree in the last 8,000 years until you get to that huge climate change uptick at the end.

Both seem to be proof of global warming until you see the trick in this [**graph**.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nasrat-Adamo/publication/327690004/figure/fig1/AS:671758415839242@1537171095688/Temperature-from-12-000BC-to-the-present-from-Greenland-ice-measurements-of-Oxygen.jpg)

This graph runs from 12,000 years ago to now, it's the Greenland ice-core temperature record and it hasn't been averaged over time. The first two graphs are heavily averaged until they only show a less than a one-tenth of a degree 'ripple. The 'disastrous' 1.5 C  blip wouldn't stand out at all if it was placed at the end of this graph. 

Now for the trick. Take a 20,000 year temperature graph and filter it until it only shows a tenth of a degree ripple over a century time-span.

Then graft unfiltered instrumental record of the past 100 or so years onto the end of the 20,000 year graph. Instant alarming climate change proof. Instant alarming climate change graph, almost zero temperature change for 8,000 years and then whammo, a huge 1.5 degrees explosion climbing like a homesick angel into uncharted territory!

Doubt that the alarmists use this trick? Look at the first graph and see the little notch at the 10,000 year mark. Now compare it to last graph at 10,000 years. What you're seeing is the Younger Dryas event, 3,000 years of ice age temperatures that have been filtered away into a half a degree temperature blip.",82,43,2024-08-17 18:46:54,en,climateskeptics
1ev0ijp,CO2 is the GREENING molecule: New study shows how elevated CO2 levels increase vegetation growth and WATER AVAILABILITY in the Northern Hemisphere,"The Democrat’s Green New Deal proposes a war on carbon dioxide, investing in methods to sequester this all-important atmospheric gas under the ground. However, according to new research, elevated CO2 levels are not only important for vegetation growth, but also play a role in maintaining water availability in the Northern Hemisphere. Artificial carbon capture and other geoengineering projects could be the main driving force behind wildfires, droughts and collapsing water tables in the Northern Hemisphere.

The study, published in Environmental Research Letters, reveals significant changes in the relationship between vegetation growth and water availability in the Northern Hemisphere's mid-latitudes over the past three decades. The research, led by Yang Song and colleagues, highlights the impact of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels on this relationship, suggesting a closer relationship between vegetation growth and water availability than previously understood.

The very compound that the Democrats are targeting – CO2 – is actually the solution to preserving croplands, grasslands, forests and water supplies for growing populations.

1eqs4od," Ships Now Spew Less Sulfur, but Warming Has Sped Up ","It's almost as if the climate policies ~~are bullshit~~ don't work. YMMV  


>RICHLAND, Wash.—Last year marked Earth’s warmest year on record. A new study finds that some of 2023’s record warmth, nearly 20 percent, likely came as a result of reduced sulfur emissions from the shipping industry. Much of this warming concentrated over the northern hemisphere.

>... When ships burn fuel, sulfur dioxide flows into the atmosphere. Energized by sunlight, chemical intermingling in the atmosphere can spur the formation of sulfur aerosols. Sulfur emissions, a form of pollution, can cause acid rain. The change was made to improve air quality around ports.

>... The authors used a [machine learning](https://www.pnnl.gov/artificial-intelligence) approach to scan over a million satellite images and quantify the declining count of ship tracks, estimating a 25 to 50 percent reduction in visible tracks. Where the cloud count was down, the degree of warming was generally up.

1elxfam,Amazon soil may store billions more tonnes of carbon than once thought,"Nutrient-rich ""dark earth"" soil may store an amount of carbon nearly equivalent to annual CO2 emissions in the US, a finding that suggests the Amazon sequesters far more carbon than previously known. 

Rich soil in the Amazon cultivated over centuries by Indigenous communities may store billions of tonnes of carbon, suggesting that the rainforest plays an even larger role in stabilising the global climate than previously thought.

The soil, known as “terra preta” or “dark earth” for its distinctive colour, is formed by people spreading ash and other organic waste around settlements. It is more fertile than the region’s typically sandy, nutrient-poor soils, and stores around double the carbon. In some areas, dark earth may contain as much carbon as the plants growing above it.

Archaeologists have identified dark earth deposits at sites across the Amazon basin, but the total amount of such soil currently present in the region remains unknown.

Samuel Goldberg at the University of Miami in Florida and his colleagues used satellite imagery to predict the areas with dark earth across the 2.6 million-hectare Xingu Indigenous Territory in the south-east Amazon. In this region, dark earth cultivation, including by modern Kuikuro farmers, has been well documented.
Because the soil is hidden from satellites by tree cover, the researchers looked at differences in the colour of the tree canopy. They found that undisturbed trees growing on dark earth have higher amounts of chlorophyll in their leaves and can reflect more infrared light.

The researchers trained a machine learning algorithm on satellite imagery data on forest colour from sites known to contain dark earth. “You can’t see it, but the satellite can,” says Goldberg. This let them predict spots with dark earth throughout the entire region.
The algorithm predicted that at least 3.4 per cent of the region, or 91,000 hectares, contained dark earth, the majority of which was unknown sites. The algorithm also had low error rates when predicting known dark earth sites. The researchers estimate this human-modified soil stores 9 million tonnes more carbon than it would otherwise.

The results from Xingu can’t reliably be extrapolated to the whole Amazon basin without more regional data. But if dark earth is present to the same extent across the more than 5.5-million-square-kilometre basin, dark earth in the Amazon could store billions of tonnes of carbon – an amount approaching the annual CO2 emissions of the US, says Goldberg.

“[Our survey] is huge relative to what you can do with a shovel at an archaeological site, but tiny relative to the entire Amazon,” he says.

""With the formation of only 3 tropical storms in the basin so far, 
activity in the eastern Pacific is at an historic low.  Typically by 
the end of July, the season produces 5 or 6 tropical storms, 3 
hurricanes, and 1 or 2 major hurricanes.  The Accumulated Cyclone 
Energy (ACE), which measures the combined strength and duration of 
tropical storms and hurricanes, is only 5 percent of the long-term 
(1991-2020) average, making this the slowest start to an eastern 
Pacific season during the reliable period of records in the basin 
(1971-2024).""

Good weather doesn't get reported because it is boring. Everyone has been focusing on the Atlantic where Hurricane Beryl became the earliest Category 5 Hurricane in the Atlantic Basin on record. 

Mother Nature has a unique way of balancing out. Usually when one basin has hyper active tropical activity, there's another that is quiet. This year may be a prime example. ",19,5,2024-08-06 11:20:27,en,climateskeptics

Not to sound crass, but the minor increase in deaths in some places appears far less than deaths from COVID-19 & simply being poor...which more would be with unreliable, non-transportable energy that depends excessively on electricity.

As Dr. Curry points out, anything we do to limit CO2 this century makes virtually no difference before 2100+, especially if natural warming is being caused by the sun & other factors.

This is from a July 2024 study I've never seen before. Basically, it shows that in many areas, deaths would decline regionally due to climate change...perhaps more than they increase elsewhere.

In 2018, a study of aerial photos of [700 Pacific Islands showed](https://joannenova.com.au/2018/11/seas-are-rising-everywhere-except-around-islands/) that 89% were the same size or growing. This rather destroyed the idea that sea levels were swallowing small nations. The New York Times said nothing. Indeed, the only Pacific things shrinking were deserted sand drifts. No islands bigger than 10 hectares were getting smaller. Measured in square kilometers that’s “0.1”. Despite the media headlines and delegations from [Kiribati](https://joannenova.com.au/2017/10/kiribati-sinking-like-titanic-but-59-million-times-slower/) and [Tuvulu](https://joannenova.com.au/2018/02/climate-change-creates-free-real-estate-in-tuvalu-climate-refugees-can-all-go-home/) begging for money to hold back the tide, no islands with people living on them were shrinking. None, not one island in the Pacific big enough to matter, was disappearing. The largest 630 islands in the Pacific were had not being touched by climate change for decades.

>....The dry air prevents the buildup of tall clouds that are needed to form a hurricane. As well, the SAL creates a temperature inversion, which means a layer of warm air remains over colder air, causing clouds to spread out rather than rise to form thunderstorms. And the strong winds that carry the layer along causes wind shear, which can tear storms apart....

>...""Whenever there's a period of quiet activity in the atmosphere, whether it's tropical storms or winter storms, usually that means there's energy building up somewhere in the ocean atmosphere system,"" he said, adding that with no strong winds stirring up the Atlantic, its surface temperatures will continue to rise -- a key source of energy for hurricanes.

In summary, storms are bad. The lack of storms are also bad. More storms are made by man. Lack of storms not made by man.

the [press release](https://www.ans.org/news/article-6241/china-pebblebed-reactor-passes-meltdown-test/) and a [scientific article](https://www.cell.com/joule/abstract/S2542-4351\(24\)00290-3). 

These two reactors  have been plugged into the grid for about 6 months.

>Researchers at Tsinghua University in China performed two safety tests on the Shidaowan plant’s reactor modules by shutting off active power supply to see if the decay heat could be removed passively. The responses of temperatures and nuclear power in each unit confirmed that they can be cooled down naturally, without active intervention.

how pebble-bed works

>Shidaowan’s twin 100-MW units house tiny uranium capsules encased in graphite shells about the size of billiard balls (dubbed “pebbles”), which make the energy density of the fuel much lower than in a traditional nuclear reactor with fuel rods. In the pebble design, the nuclear fission reaction occurs more slowly than in conventional reactors, but the fuel can withstand higher temperatures for longer and the heat resulting from the fission reaction is dispersed, enabling a passive cooling process.

>The reactor doesn’t rely on large volumes of water in the cooling process—instead, a small amount of helium gas, which can withstand much higher temperatures than water, is piped through the system to naturally cool it down. If the reactor starts to get too hot, its components automatically slow down the nuclear reaction and the system cools. This setup makes such a reactor “meltdown proof,” in concept.",14,2,2024-07-26 10:57:09,en,climateskeptics

1ebw085,Michael Shellenberger’s book “San Fransicko” provides a deeper understanding of the Far Left - a good read if you want to understand movements such as Just Stop Oil and Antifa.,"I just finished reading this book and I found it entertaining, disturbing and a Rosetta Stone to better understand what drives the Far Left.

https://www.amazon.com/San-Fransicko-Progressives-Ruin-Cities/dp/0063093626

San Fransicko refers to San Francisco and its homeless. We learn how the Far Left throws the homeless under the bus for their own interests. In this sense, San Fransicko points at what is wrong with the Far Left. These people are sick in the head (Shellenberger: “... the so-called Dark Triad personality traits of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy."")

1e8tyj1,"Mother Nature can solve climate change, without human help/intervention","I was just wondering something, as a weather hobbyist for 33+ years.......if the air and oceans are indeed warming, as climate change activists say, that means with warmer ocean/sea water temperature means more evaporation, and hence, more water vapor. With an increase in global air temperature, that means that air can hold more moisture, as its capacity increases, as the temperature of the air goes up, because, as we learned in chemistry class, a solution can hold more solutes (in this case, earth's atmosphere is the solvent, with water vapor as the liquid solute), when you raise its overall temperature.

With more evaporation and increase in the capacity for air to hold more moisture, due to rising sea water and air temperatures, that would mean more clouds and rain.

More clouds and rain, would mean that the earth's surface would get less sunlight, as it would be blocked by the clouds and rain (more sunlight would be reflected by the clouds, back into outer space), which would then lead to temperatures to cool down, thereby, restoring a natural balance or equilibrium, in terms of the global air and sea water temperatures. This is similar to the process of homeostasis.

This would be a natural feedback loop, by which Nature will, on her own, without human help or intervention will fight the rising global temperatures - both the air and even the sea/ocean temperatures. It will take decades or even centuries to do, but Nature will succeed. 

There is no climate crisis, because eventually, Nature will eventually restore balance and equilibrium, through natural physical processes. We need to trust in nature.....go with the flow.",24,8,2024-07-21 15:10:20,en,climateskeptics

Fake scientific papers are alarmingly common

“When neuropsychologist Bernhard Sabel put his new fake-paper detector to work, he was “shocked” by what it found. After screening some 5000 papers, he estimates up to 34% of neuroscience papers published in 2020 were likely made up or plagiarized; in medicine, the figure was 24%. Both numbers, which he and colleagues report in a medRxiv preprint posted on 8 May, are well above levels they calculated for 2010—and far larger than the 2% baseline estimated in a 2022 publishers’ group report.”

New safety concerns identified for 1 in 3 FDA-approved drugs

“Conclusions
Among 222 novel therapeutics approved by the FDA from 2001 through 2010, 32% were affected by a postmarket safety event. Biologics, psychiatric therapeutics, and accelerated and near–regulatory deadline approval were statistically significantly associated with higher rates of events. The high frequency of postmarket safety events highlights the need for continuous monitoring of the safety of novel therapeutics throughout their life cycle.”

* The FDA budget for FY 2019 is $5.9 billion.
* About 55 percent, or $3.2 billion, of FDA’s budget is provided by federal budget authorization. The remaining 45 percent, or $2.7 billion, is paid for by industry user fees.”

Hidden conflicts? Pharma payments to FDA advisers after drug approvals spark ethical concerns
Science investigation of journal disclosures and pharmaceutical funding records shows potential influence on physician gatekeepers

“Among the investigation's key findings:
* Of 107 physician advisers who voted on the committees Science examined, 40 over a nearly 4-year period received more than $10,000 in post hoc earnings or research support from the makers of drugs that the panels voted to approve, or from competing firms; 26 of those gained more than $100,000; and six more than $1 million.
* Of the more than $24 million in personal payments or research support from industry to the 16 top-earning advisers—who received more than $300,000 each—93% came from the makers of drugs those advisers previously reviewed or from competitors.
* Most of those top earners—and many others—received other funds from those same companies, concurrent with or in the year before their advisory service. Those payments were disclosed in scholarly journals but not by FDA.”       


“Elliott suggests a more radical solution. ""Even in the best of circumstances, disclosure is a remarkably weak way of controlling conflicts of interest,"" he says. ""A better way would simply be for the FDA to say, ‘We are not taking anybody with any kind of conflict on an advisory committee.'""

The largest scientific experiment in history was Peer Review and it failed

“Why don’t reviewers catch basic errors and blatant fraud? One reason is that they almost never look at the data behind the papers they review, which is exactly where the errors and fraud are most likely to be. In fact, most journals don’t require you to make your data public at all. You’re supposed to provide them “on request,” but most people don’t. That’s how we’ve ended up in sitcom-esque situations like ~20% of genetics papers having totally useless data because Excel autocorrected the names of genes into months and years.”

“But science is a strong-link problem: progress depends on the quality of our best work. Better ideas don’t always triumph immediately, but they do triumph eventually, because they’re more useful. You can’t land on the moon using Aristotle’s physics, you can’t turn mud into frogs using spontaneous generation, and you can’t build bombs out of phlogiston. Newton’s laws of physics stuck around; his recipe for the Philosopher’s Stone didn’t. We didn’t need a scientific establishment to smother the wrong ideas. We needed it to let new ideas challenge old ones, and time did the rest.
Weak-link thinking makes scientific censorship seem reasonable, but all censorship does is make old ideas harder to defeat.”

>Haliade-X turbines that will be attached to the monopiles drilled into the sea floor will reach 853 feet in the air at the tip of the blade, each nearly as tall as the Eiffel Tower. There will eventually be a total of 62 turbines constructed in the Vineyard Wind 1 lease area, and as of mid-July, 19 had been completed, with 10 operational.

>It's unclear if the broken turbine is the result of a blade failure during operation, or some sort of impact during its installation.

'Vineyard Wind 1' is the area but even more upscale Nantucket Island is downwind, apparently. fwiw the heads of Google and GE have beach homes there, as does ex-climate czar John Kerry and his ketchup-heiress wife.

1e4rxc1,Do you need a PhD to make your EV battery last longer?,"- Don't store your car at 100% for long periods of time, especially at high temperatures 
- Do frequently recharge, ideally when you get to 40% charging only to 60%, meaning just 20% range or 50 miles on a 250 mile range EV
- If going on long trip, only charge to 75%, but even then preferably recharge when you get to 30%
- At beginning, he says your car may lose 10% of available charge the very first recharge! No wonder no EV ever matches their range rating!

Bottom line: EVs are a headache if you run them hot or cold, charge them hot or cold, or try to use the advertised 100% range. ",14,5,2024-07-16 11:44:20,en,climateskeptics
1e4u9l4,Gulf water temperature vs air temperatures,"I was just debating someone on another subreddit and realized that I need help confirming my explanation.

In 2023, Gulf of Mexico water temperatures where in the high 90's and some measurements approaching 100F.  This was near Key West where the air temperature is much cooler (often around 92-93F).

I pointed out that the other major source of heat besides the sun is geothermal heat.  It is already known that there is geothermal heating of the Gulf so having a water temperature much higher than the air temperature would imply to me that there is an additional source of heat that the water sees that the air is not exposed to, geothermal heating.

[Nature Microbiology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01715-9)

A common type of ocean algae plays a significant role in producing a massively abundant compound that helps cool the Earth’s climate, new research has discovered. 
 
The findings of the study by the University of East Anglia (UEA) and Ocean University of China (OUC) could change our understanding of how these tiny marine organisms impact our planet. 
 
The team identified the bloom-forming Pelagophyceae algae as potentially abundant and important producers of a compound called dimethylsulfoniopropionate, or DMSP.  
 
Co-lead author Professor Jonathan Todd, of UEA’s School of Biological Sciences, said: “The Pelagophyceae are amongst the most abundant algae on Earth, yet they were not previously known as important producers of DMSP.  
 
“This discovery is exciting because DMSP is an abundant antistress compound, food source for other microorganisms and major source of climate-cooling gases.”  
 
Dr Jinyan Wang, OUC/UEA PhD student and first author, said: “Understanding the role of Pelagophyceae in DMSP production means we need to rethink how much of this compound is being produced and how it impacts our climate."" 
 
Every year, billions of tonnes of DMSP are produced in the Earth's oceans by marine microorganisms, helping them to survive by protecting against various stresses like changes in salinity, cold, high pressure, and oxidative stress.  
 
Importantly, DMSP is the main source of a climate active gas called dimethylsulfide (DMS), which is known as the smell of the seaside.  
 
This study suggests that DMSP production, and consequently DMS release, is likely higher than previously predicted and emphasises the key role of microbes in regulating global climate.

Mapped monthly data products of surface ocean acidification indicators from 1998 to 2022 on a 0.25° by 0.25° spatial grid have been developed for eleven U.S. large marine ecosystems (LMEs). The data products were constructed using observations from the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas, co-located surface ocean properties, and two types of machine learning algorithms: Gaussian mixture models to organize LMEs into clusters of similar environmental variability and random forest regressions (RFRs) that were trained and applied within each cluster to spatiotemporally interpolate the observational data. The data products, called RFR-LMEs, have been averaged into regional timeseries to summarize the status of ocean acidification in U.S. coastal waters, showing a domain-wide carbon dioxide partial pressure increase of 1.4 ± 0.4 μatm yr−1 and pH decrease of 0.0014 ± 0.0004 yr−1. RFR-LMEs have been evaluated via comparisons to discrete shipboard data, fixed timeseries, and other mapped surface ocean carbon chemistry data products. Regionally averaged timeseries of RFR-LME indicators are provided online through the NOAA National Marine Ecosystem Status web portal.",7,11,2024-07-04 02:19:33,en,climateskeptics

>The Silicon Valley company’s pollution amounted to 14.3 million tonnes of carbon equivalent in 2023, a 48 percent increase from its 2019 baseline and a 13 percent rise since last year, Google said in its annual environmental report on Tuesday.

>Google said the jump highlighted “the challenge of reducing emissions” at the same time as it invests in the build-out of large language models and their associated applications and infrastructure, admitting that “the future environmental impact of AI” was “complex and difficult to predict.”

>Chief Sustainability Officer Kate Brandt said the company remained committed to the 2030 target but stressed the “extremely ambitious” nature of the goal.

>“We do still expect our emissions to continue to rise before dropping towards our goal,” said Brandt.

Although finance remains the most popular career option for Columbia climate majors, Schaefer notes that there are two other fast-growing fields: climate justice and climate communications. The first focuses on how climate change disproportionately impacts marginalized populations and looks to create climate solutions that don’t exacerbate current inequities. The communications focus looks to bridge the gap between climate scientists who are pressing for change and the politicians, industry leaders, and wider public who have the power to make it happen.

At Montana, where the causes and effects of climate change are tangible due to the occurrence of wildfires and unsustainable state energy policy, McDonough has seen a large increase in students interested in the mental health aspects of tackling the crisis.

In the ""climate emergency"" where EV's are the Savior, the US/Europe have opened Pandora's box to China that has cheap energy, owns the Lithium, and can engineer a great product.

What is the non-planet saving response by these two, slap 100% tarrifs on sensible cars that could actually save the planet. Environmental 'Judo' 🥋

>The car, launched last year by Chinese automaker BYD, sells for around $12,000 in China, but drives well and is put together with craftsmanship that rivals U.S.-made electric vehicles that cost three times as much. A shorter-range version costs under $10,000.

>Outside of China, EVs are often pricey, aimed at a higher-income niche market.

>The Western markets did not democratize EVs. They gentrified EVs,” said Bill Russo, the founder of the Automobility Ltd. consultancy in Shanghai. “And when you gentrify, you limit the size of the market. China is all about democratizing EVs, and that’s what will ultimately lead Chinese companies to be successful as they go global.”

EV's are/were a status symbol in the West, leather seats, with +$7500 incentives. That incentive could almost pay completely for the Seagull. Governments quickly realizing, people without jobs, don't vote for thier party...the 'gentrified' planet be damned.

The mighty Columbia River has helped power the American West with hydroelectricity since the days of FDR’s New Deal. But the artificial intelligence revolution will demand more. Much more.

>So near the river’s banks in Central Washington, Microsoft is betting on an effort to generate power from atomic fusion — the collision of atoms that powers the sun — a breakthrough that has eluded scientists for the past century. Physicists predict it will elude Microsoft, too.

>The tech giant and its partners say they expect to harness fusion by 2028, an audacious claim that bolsters their promises to transition to green energy but distracts from current reality. In fact, the voracious electricity consumption of artificial intelligence is driving an expansion of fossil fuel use — including delaying the retirement of some coal-fired plants.

>In the face of this dilemma, Big Tech is going all in on experimental clean-energy projects that have long odds of success anytime soon. In addition to fusion, they are hoping to generate power through such futuristic schemes as small nuclear reactors hooked to individual computing centers and machinery that taps geothermal energy by boring 10,000 feet into the Earth’s crust.

1dl6zsn,SUBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION ON CLIMATE CHANGE DEFINITION AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE PUBLIC'S (POLITICAL) VIEW. QUESTIONS TO THINK ABOUT IT.,"We should write a book about this argument because there is a lot of misinterpretation that affect the public view on the CLIMATE CHANGE phenomenon.

Let’s start reading the following scientific definition of CLIMATE CHANGE:

BRITANNICA ENCYCLOPEDIA:

*Climate change, periodic modification of Earth’s climate brought about as a result of changes in the atmosphere as well as interactions between the atmosphere and various other geologic, chemical, biological, and geographic factors within the Earth system.*

*(*[*https://www.britannica.com/science/climate-change*](https://www.britannica.com/science/climate-change)*)*

 

Now let’s compare it with the following definitions:

 

UNITED NATIONS:

*Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s,* [*primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.*](https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/) *human activities have been the main driver of climate change.*

*(*[*https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change*](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change)*)*

 

***QUESTION 1:***

***SINCE WE ARE A PRODUCT OF THE NATURE AND WE ARE PART OF IT, DO HUMANS ARE STILL THINKING WE ARE DIFFERENTS AND UNIQUE (ANTHROPOCENTRIC VIEW)?***

***QUESTION 2:***

***SINCE WE ARE AWARE OF OUR CONTRIBUTION ON THE ACTUAL CLIMATIC CHANGE, SHOULD HUMAN THINKS RATIONALLY TO MITIGATE IT OR SHOULD WE ACCEPT IT AS A NATURAL PROCESS?***

***QUESTION 3:***

***SINCE CAPITALISM IS DRIVEN BY PROFIT, AND MONEY ARE AT THE BASE OF EVERYTHING IN LIFE, SHOULD WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM TO MITIGATE AND EVENTUALLY REDUCE THE ACTUAL CLIMATE CHANGE?***

 

***My personal opinion is that it is impossible to stop the actual climate change. Probably we can try to mitigate it but there are many others factors that came into the big picture that are out of our control. It is like to try to save the coast line from erosion, or to stop a landslide, or a volcanic eruption. Maybe it will work for some years but at the end force of gravity, tides, waves, sea level, plate tectonic will win.***",8,2,2024-06-21 11:39:51,en,climateskeptics

1djiij2,A little story from my piece of the world and how an outsider wouldn’t understand…(climate change insanity related),"So I live in Indiana. we have had a pretty wet spring so far. Only in recent weeks has it dried out. it was good because last fall was exceptionally dry due to the strong El Niño. 

We also have a small summer home in Northeast Indiana. For as long as I can remember going back to childhood, there have been irrigation systems in the corn and soybean fields. Why is that? Because the soil in that area contains less clay and is more porous than soil and the central and southern regions of Indiana. Regular rains are not enough to help the crops grow. It has been like this since the 80s when we started going up there. 

Why is that important? Because I’m going to give you an example of someone not familiar with the area could cry “climate change“! Without knowing the facts….. our very modest home has a small yard which can be easily push mowed. Two weekends ago (after not being up there due to my son’s baseball schedule for about a month) that yard was long and green. It definitely needed to be mowed. That Saturday night we got a downpour but it did not rain the entire week afterwards, and when we return the following Friday the yard was brown. now knowing the area as I do… I did not panic. Because: this is the time of year when the sun is at its peak and strongest in terms of solar output for Indiana. We are approaching solstice, things dry out rather quickly. Most people up that way water their yards if they want them to stay green when we hit this time of year. I really don’t care because we don’t play around in the yard a ton and spend most of our time on the lake… by the way has not dried up, lol. It is spring fed and even in drought conditions still contains more than enough water to go boating. 

My over arching point is this: someone with no knowledge of that area would immediately conclude that a drought is going on and that climate change is to blame…..never mind the fact that just a week prior the grass was super tall and lush green. But because of the heat and power of the sun combined with soil that does not hold water very well, things dry out fast. 

That’s just my little snapshot as to why it is important to know your surroundings and historical trends beyond just weather. It took me well into adulthood to understand the soil and its factor as to why the grass “ browns out” so quickly vs. the yard in my central Indiana home (which is still very green and growing well despite a period of dryness)

I encourage others to share similar stories….",16,5,2024-06-19 08:56:30,en,climateskeptics

1diza6n, City Sprawl Now Large Enough to Sway Global Warming Over Land ,">RICHLAND, Wash.—Just how much heat does city sprawl add to large-scale warming? That’s one longstanding question researchers sought to answer in a [new study](https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1jF2K9C%7EIu3zcp) recently published in the journal *One Earth.* 

>Once thought to cover too little of the Earth’s surface to affect climate at larger scales, the new work suggests that urbanization does indeed have a detectable influence on global warming over land, with more to potentially follow as cities continue growing.

1dgz2lf,USC study confirms the rotation of Earth’s inner core has slowed; began to decrease its speed around 2010. “The dance of the inner core might be even more lively than we know so far.”,"The inner core gradually super-rotated from 2003 to 2008, and then from 2008 to 2023 sub-rotated two to three times more slowly back through the same path. These matches enable precise and unambiguous tracking of inner core progression and regression. The resolved different rates of forward and backward motion suggest that new models will be necessary for the dynamics between the inner core, outer core and mantle.

Our method and observations provide the most definitive evidence so far that the IC is moving relative to the rest of the Earth, and specifically that it is slowly and smoothly rotating on a reversing path. The observation that the westward sub-rotation is less than half as fast as the last part of the eastward super-rotation is well-resolved and begs models with that character. 

Identification of repeating pairs in which waveform changes and ddt from rotation cancel will allow greater resolution in the question of whether other processes near the IC boundary are also appearing. Examination with these methods of repeating IC waves on other paths, further in the past and into the future, promises rapid progress in monitoring motion in a difficult and enigmatic region.",28,5,2024-06-15 23:50:16,en,climateskeptics

There is a need to explore the physical connections between heliospheric compression and planetary climates and atmospheres. The consequences of the Earth being exposed to the ISM are outside the present work. Here we just comment briefly on some of them. First, there is a possible consequence for Earth's climate. 

Large amounts of neutral hydrogen as a result of an encounter with cold clouds with densities above 1,000 cm-3 will alter the chemistry of Earth's atmosphere. This needs careful examination including the physics of cloud formation. Very few works have investigated the climatic effects of such encounters quantitatively in the context of encounters with dense giant molecular clouds. 

Some argue that such high densities would deplete the ozone in the mid-atmosphere (50-100 km) and eventually cool the Earth43,44. This work should be revisited with modern atmospheric modelling. This cooling is aligned with what is seen for oxygen isotopes measured in the microscopic skeletons of foraminifera on the sea floor*5. 

It has been suggested that climate changes around this time could have affected human evolution 46,47,48,49. The hypothesis is that the emergence of our species Homo sapiens was shaped by the need to adapt to climate changeS. With the shrinkage of the heliosphere, the Earth was exposed directly to the ISM.

Another effect would be increased radiation from an increased flux of GCRs. Voyagers 1 and 2 showed that the heliosphere shields the GCRs for intensities 70 MeV-5 GeV by 80% (refs. 151). During the passage through a cold cloud, Earth is exposed to the bare GCR intensity, which is enhanced further by the compression of the cold cloud if the GCRs are trapped within the cloud, although some studies 2 argue that the GCR spectra in dense clouds are like the local ISM. 

Detailed modelling of GCR diffusion is needed to explore the impact of GCRs on climate and habitability. Additionally, the passage through such a dense cloud would have an additional effect on Earth's atmosphere through interstellar dust accumulation 3. This also should be investigated.",18,1,2024-06-15 22:57:55,en,climateskeptics
1dgkmja,"Diversity and inclusion for you, but not for us","The more we understand about how spectacularly wrong and dumb the CO2's Enhanced Greenhouse Effect theory is, the more I wonder how we got here in the first place.

Granted, it took me a couple of years to figure it out, but I have a job to do and a family to feed. But there were people who are paid to study ""climate science"", and I find it hard to believe 97% of them fell for the idea and did not do their due dilligence. Because it is not difficult at all to figure out and these people, who all went to (good) universities, can not all be this dumb.

One of the posters here says it is difficult to be critical if your paycheck depends on not being critical, and I get that, but there must have been at least one ""climate scientist"" or one ""journalist"" who thought, hold on a second, something is not right here..

Our brain works in a rather idiotic way. This has to do with how our brain evolved: is the animal walking over there food, or am I going to be food? To survive, the few milliseconds which were gained by making the correct decision led to an evolution into the current design. And in this design, the brain constantly makes assumptions based on past experiences, with our sensors (eyes, ears, etc) having to convince the brain it is wrong, and this leads to confirmation bias: we see what we want to see and we hear what we want to hear. If you want to go a bit deeper, check [YouTube for the McGurk effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFPtc8BVdJk). I guarantee you will be shocked.

Cool story bro, but what does this have to do with climate change?

[When Sabine Hossenfelder discussed the Greenhouse Effect on YouTube, she struggled with the material. How did the Greenhouse Effect work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqu5DjzOBF8) But she had already made the assumption it was working, and her brain was doing its best to put the puzzle together. Confirmation bias.

This brings me to the title of my piece: we got here, because the media and the (social) sciences are dominated by the Left, and their confirmation bias has replaced common sense with dogma. This could have been avoided if a few of us would have been present, but these bastions of the Left do not tolerate us very well. Which is ironic, given their fascination with DEI. DEI for us, but not for them.

A similar effect can be seen when the media and left wing politicians are going bonkers about another ""unexpected"" election result. The fact is that the majority of the people are not siding with them, but with us. And I'm fed up with these assholes telling us in their shitty newspapers and their horrible ""news"" shows how to live and what to do, while they refuse to play by their own rules.

You want diversity? What about this: if your rag, news station, or university does not have a reasonable representation of the political landscape, you WILL be affected by confirmation bias and you WILL NOT be able to fulfill your mission statement. Since most of these assholes are funded with tax payers' money, it is crucial to demand a fair representation.

1dehlg8,Michael Mann funny again,"You don't even need to have a critical attitude to embarrass a ""climate scientist"" like Michael Mann over the biased BS he talks. This one is an amazingly funny example.

Mann promoted the talking point of how accurate models are and so he matched the average model output against the actual temperature record, fitting like a glove. What con-artists do in these cases is fondling with (already manipulated) temperature records to better fit them with the model output. Unless you make a screenshot and look at it pixel by pixel, you could not tell. His chart therefore shows a warming of at least 1.2°C since the 1970s.

Regrettably for Mann the talk settles on the 1.5°C threshold with Mann explaining it would be broken by the early 2030s. What he forgot is that said treshold is not relative to the 1970s, but to ""pre-industrial"". At that point it became way too obvious that his chart had far too much warming. If the Earth had warming 1.2°C since the 1970s, then of course we had went beyond the 1.5°C threshold already.

It is also easy to see looking at it another way. Since the mid 1970s five decades have past. If there were 1.2°C warming since then, that would equate to a 0.24°C/decade warming trend. The actual warming trend is only 0.14-0.15 with satellite data, and 0.18-0.19 with other data sets (GISS, hadcrut..). So we are officially at 0.7 to 0.95°C of warming since then alltogether, not 1.2°C.

Just watch Mann trying to talk himself out of the hole he just digged. And honor the comment by Mr. Dan Miller (""Ok, I'm confused now.."") LOL

1deez58,"Is 3.0 Really Greater Than 0.85? - “Well, you might think so but you would be applying the naïve mathematics of the climate change denier.""","by John Ridgway

According to the BBC, we now live in a world of misinformation and fake news, in which fake experts and denialists peddle anti-science conspiracies that endanger us all. This has led to the establishment of fact-checking, in which the so-called denialist claims are seemingly debunked by self-appointed arbiters of the truth. To illustrate how these fact-checks often work in practice, I offer you the following fictional account of how the BBC Verify team might deal with one particularly interesting online talking point that is currently gaining traction. In keeping with fact-checking tradition, we start with a clear declaration of the ‘misinformation’ to be debunked:

One of the most recent of false narratives to appear on the internet has been the assertion that 3.0 is greater than 0.85, a view favoured by climate change deniers, seemingly based solely upon a rudimentary understanding of mathematics gained at a very early stage in their education. But is it really true that a number such as 3.0 can be said to be greater than 0.85? In the simplistic world of the fake expert, the answer would be yes, but in the world of climate change risk management, in which the vast majority of the world’s scientists are in agreement, a much more nuanced and context-driven reality emerges.

The problem with the naïve pseudo-mathematics of the climate change denier is that it often fails to understand the true importance of the numbers concerned, but it is only when this importance is taken into account that reliable statements can be made regarding magnitude. The fake experts will point out that when the units are the same, the numbers are directly comparable. But that is where the misdirection is introduced. Using the same units is only part of the issue. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the recent and rapidly spreading online conspiracy theory that 3.0 is greater than 0.85. To get to the bottom of the matter we consulted our specialist disinformation specialists team to find out where this false narrative is coming from and why it is fake news. This is what they had to say:

“This particularly damaging example of misinformation seems to have started with the publication of a study that showed how climate models have predicted that climate change will lead to a 0.85 metre rise in sea level within the next century for the South Eastern city of Jakarta.”

But is this particular 0.85 actually equal to 0.85? Well, according to our fact-checkers, the answer seems to be ‘probably’.

“According to the models, the figure of 0.85m is the most likely extent of the sea level rise, but the models contain a lot of uncertainties. Accordingly, the value of 0.85 is just a guess. Furthermore, it is based upon a premised 5oC warming relative to 1870, which is far from certain. However, it is a very worrying figure, and that is what is important.”

Yes, but how does this explain why some deniers have wrongly come to the conclusion that 3.0 is greater than this figure?

“Well, if we were dealing with an even greater level of global warming, the models would indeed predict an even greater sea level rise, possibly even 3 metres or more. In such circumstances 3.0 would certainly be greater than 0.85 because that would be an even more worrying impact of climate change. But that is not where this particular 3.0 has come from. This 3.0 is due to the fact that the city of Jakarta has already sunk by over 3 metres in the last 100 years due to subsidence (with 2.5 of that happening in the last decade). And the rate of subsidence is accelerating, so another 100 years may very well result in a further 3 metres of subsidence at the very least.”

But surely that is a lot more worrying than a 0.85 metre sea-level rise and so this 3.0 is more worrying, and hence it is surely greater than 0.85.

“Well, you might think so but you would be applying the naïve mathematics of the climate change denier. That is not how climate risk mathematics works because, according to experts, “sinking land reinforces the problem of climate change-driven sea-level rise“. For something to be a reinforcing factor it cannot, by definition, be of greater magnitude than the factor it is reinforcing. If it were, then the reinforcing would be the other way round. And since a land drop of 1 metre is equivalent to a sea-level rise of 1 metre, the only way in which the subsidiary role of subsidence can be explained is by recognising that 3.0 is actually less than 0.85, despite appearances.”

So is this all about climate change deniers yet again failing to understand how the scientific method works?

“Certainly. And it is a classic case of facts being taken out of context to prove a point. It may be a fact that in disciplines such as civil engineering 3.0 is always greater than 0.85, but that doesn’t mean that the same can be said in climate science, where a huge scientific consensus exists to tell us that sea-level rise due to climate change is the greatest threat faced by coastal cities. Insisting on retaining the narrow (and quite frankly irrelevant) mathematical sense in which 3.0 is greater than 0.85, is tantamount to denying the scientific consensus, and is just typical of the logical flaws employed by the denier. To the layperson, such arguments may appear convincing but to anyone steeped in climate science the claim that 3.0 is greater than 0.85 just doesn’t make any sense because that would mean that subsidence is a greater problem than climate change-driven sea-level rise, which according to nearly every scientist in the world isn’t true. That is why, when the BBC reported on this problem it was keen to stress that subsidence only represents a ‘bigger immediate problem’. In the long term, subsidence is still only reinforcing the problem.”

Are there any other numbers that climate change deniers are pushing as being greater than 0.85?

“Yes. Shanghai and New Orleans had both subsided by more than 2 metres in the 20th century, leading climate change deniers to falsely conclude that such cities are more at risk from simply sinking into the sea over the next hundred years than they are from being overwhelmed by a posited 0.85 metre sea-level rise. They also argue that since Shanghai has obviously adapted to its historical 2 metre subsidence without too much fuss and bother, it should also be able to adapt to a 0.85 metres sea-level rise. Once again, these arguments only make superficial sense due to an insistence on sticking to the inappropriate belief that 2.0 is greater than 0.85, thereby denying the consensus within climate science that climate change-driven sea-level rise poses the greatest risk. In fact, there are a host of numbers that have been falsely deemed to be greater than 0.85 based on the likelihood that the majority of coastal cities in the world will, under their own weight, subside by a figure significantly greater than the magnitude of sea-level rise predicted by climate models (albeit, only greater in that consensus-denying mathematical sense beloved of denialists).”

So there you have it. The science is clear. Climate change will lead to inundation of coastal cities due to sea-level rise unless we immediately abandon fossil fuels. Any suggestion that coastal cities are going to sink anyway, leading to far greater inundations than are predicted by climate models, is a false narrative spread by climate change deniers employing mathematical trickery that fails to take into account the existence of a scientific consensus.

The science is settled. Numbers are just denialist talking points. Consider yourself debunked.

Further Reading:

You may wish to read this for an account of ‘climate reductionism’ and the problems facing Jakarta. The false narrative that subsidence is merely a reinforcing factor is clearly impeding Jakarta from dealing with its flooding problems.

For the standard, approved narrative, in which the scale of the subsidence problem is downplayed and framed as a reinforcing rather than principal factor, you may wish to read what ClimateCheck has to say on the matter.

With that in mind, we have created a [set of rules to try and stay on topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateOffensive/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_submissions_and_comments) . Although none of us mods wish moderating or rules were necessary (believe it or not we do have lives), experience has shown us it simply isn't feasible to take a completely hands off approach.

So with the goal of staying focused on productive climate action, we please ask that you read the [rules and guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimateOffensive/wiki/rules#wiki_rules_for_submissions_and_comments) before submitting or commenting. **Ignorance of the rules is not an excuse** and **those who break them will be penalized at the discretion of the mods**.

In short,

* **Submissions must relate to action** and **direct users to actually do something!** If it is not *abundantly clear* you are asking the user to do something, it probably belongs somewhere else.
* **Treat others and their ideas respectfully**. Not everyone will agree on how to solve the climate crisis. That is okay. But do so politely and respectfully. It doesn't matter how wrong the other person is or how right you are, *there is no excuse to act like a jerk.*
* **No misinformation, fact denial, or propaganda**. You may not misrepresent reality just because you don't like it. If you are unsure of something, don't state is as a fact! Further, do your own research! Stuff you saw on YouTube, Reddit, or Facebook does not count as research. If you can't find good peer reviewed sources on a topic, I and many others here are happy to help you search for peer-reviewed articles. Just ask!
* **No inactivism!** Being critical of and discouraging people from taking action **goes against the very core mission of this subreddit**. If you want to be a [doomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomer), we will very kindly show you the door. Such attitudes are [incredibly destructive and play right into the hands of those responsible for destroying the climate](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-deniers-shift-tactics-to-inactivism/).

* **Don't spam!** Unless you ask and we expressly give you permission **do not self-promote.** This is not the place to promote your personal blog, YouTube channel, twitter account, startup, or whatever it may be. If you believe something you're working on is concretely climate action, please do [ask us first](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/ClimateOffensive) before promoting!

Nobody you know.

Non combat, service oriented, a plumber, carpenter, electrical,and mason.  I have been around the world.

Humanitarian service awards for Honduras, After Hurricane Mitch, a fine example of what climate change actually causes.  Deaths on a scale you can't imagine.

Whole villages, just gone.  Buried under tons of landslide too wet to stay on top of a mountain.  It just slides down, drowning it's victims young and old in debris and soils, mud.

We rebuilt schools, roads, bridges, and infrastructure.  The school we build in the now flat plain that buried the previous village, it's former tenants now too deep to recover.  A foundation of casualties in this war against nature and climate change caused by human activities.

I was on the team that built the first ozone friendly refrigerant, Klea R134a, back in 1992. It was built by the Queen, her company ICI Americas, at a little place called St. Gabriel, Louisiana .  We were the first, climate change initiative plant to be Montreal protocol compliant.  Environmentally Conscious.

Since the 80's I have been in Emergency Management.  Fire fighting, HAZMAT, HAZWOPER, search and rescue.  I have seen fires become more frequent and more deadly each year of my 55 years of life.

I don't care about the cause anymore I care about action.  Having a plan that however hard it is.  Might work.

It's hard.  It's a tough read.  It might even be very antagonizing to those with attachments. It's brutally honest but not without mistakes.

It discusses concepts some will take violent offense to.

It does present a solution however hard it may be..

You, have 17 veterans commiting suicide every day in the US.  This plan, involves those veterans who wish to serve you again.

Not as your soldiers in war, but as your volunteers to serve in emergency management, serving you the only way they can now.

For peace.  This army that is dying every day, can be used to serve you in these upcoming turbulent times 

I have SEEN IT.  with my own two eyes and two hands.  You need us as much as we need you.

Let us serve you again.  For peace, and so that you might have the heros you need when the time comes

1fm2zv4,How to scale up enhanced rock weathering ,"Enhanced rock weathering is a critical asset for climate restoration. Spreading basalt rock powder over agricultural fields simotaniously remove anthropological CO2 from the atmosphere and fertilize agricultural soil. Mine tailings are a source of basalt rock but that will not be enough to meet demand if enhanced rock weathering becomes a widespread practice. 

A basalt mining industry is the solution to this problem. Such a basalt mining industry would need to be capable of mining large amounts of basalt rock on a 24/7 basis to keep up with demand. Basalt mining will need to be done alongside the extraction of basalt from mine tailings in order to maximize the sustainability of the basalt supply chain. 

I propose repurposing the following high capacity opencast mining machines to mine basalt for enhanced rock weathering 

[Bucket wheel excavator ](https://preview.redd.it/y8ppde5ms5qd1.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=60c2373123d0d3ce73b2e6f47c4a11ab78e92716)

[Bucket chain excavator](https://preview.redd.it/63559w5zt5qd1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=5298b5a5342278b812295e4e598d68c18883f934)

[Walking dragline](https://preview.redd.it/ybbstys8u5qd1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=b327929a9e78a7ba0182a3f83d91ec11a80be1aa)

[Stripping shovel](https://preview.redd.it/nrn1ldyuu5qd1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4b86d0dadc44689635b7eb953efabd89f91c968)

If enhanced rock weathering becomes a widespread practice the demand for basalt will be enormous. Large amounts of basalt will need to be mined continuously every year in order to meet demand. Not only will the demand be for carbon removal but also for the fertilization of agricultural soil. Normal mining machinery would not be able to keep up with demand, so therefore I propose repurposing lignite mining machinery for basalt mining. Basalt deposits are usually close to the surface because basalt is formed by cooling lava. 

Basalt is an igneous rock so therefore all basalt deposits are located in volcanic or formerly volcanic regions. Volcanic regions do not host carbon sink or biodiverse ecosystems because volcanic soil is not sufficiently fertile. The environmental impacts of basalt rock mining can (and should) be mitigated by reclaiming the land after mining just like how lignite mines are reclaimed.  

[Reclaimers like the one shown in this image can be used for opencast basalt mine reclamation](https://preview.redd.it/nv5es8a7x5qd1.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d91e823f650a315eae3321a507349cd89f09d4c)

Here are the hurdles that need to be overcome to make this proposal a reality 

1. High capacity opencast mining machines will need to be modified handle the hardness of basalt 

2. A carbon neutral energy source will be needed to power high capacity mining machines which cannot power themselves because they will be mining basalt not lignite that can be fed to power plants that supply electricity to the machines 

3. The environmental impacts of opencast basalt mining using repurposed high capacity mining machinery will need to be carefully evaluated in order to minimize environmental harm 

High capacity opencast mining machinery can be repurposed for a climate neutral future. If these sorts of machines are repurposed for basalt mining, they would quite literally be undoing all of the climate impact that they caused when they were used for lignite mining. High capacity opencast mining machinery will not be without any usefulness in a lignite free world. ",9,7,2024-09-21 09:26:56,en,ClimateOffensive

1fjre4m,A food system that will restore Earths climate ,"  
Restoring Earths climate to its pre-industrial state will require removing trillions of tons of anthropological CO2 from the atmosphere once the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is stopped from increasing. Agriculture can (and should) be one of several ways to do this. Moving all of this carbon from the atmosphere into agricultural soil can help reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and maintain the fertility of agricultural soils at the same time. 

In this climate restoration oriented food system all food is produced using these three methods 

1. Regenerative agriculture 

https://preview.redd.it/jdns3img0kpd1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=264ca35a67ca042db7888594e064c78dcf945c59

2. Regenerative aquaculture 

https://preview.redd.it/me4uw0qbzjpd1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6a7108f4ec3241cea879bef47d123b96ad01e20

3. Plaudiculture 

[Note: Not all crops can be grown in peat soil, the crops that can grow in peat soil are ones which can withstand the acidity and moisture of peat soil](https://preview.redd.it/hvrv49wxzjpd1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee816043f275a81662127b688a63c79312ee9e8f)

Here is the climate impact of each of these methods 

1. Regenerative agriculture has the potential to remove CO2 from the atmosphere 

2. Regenerative aquaculture as the potential to remove CO2 from the ocean 

3. Plaudiculture has the potential to preserve the carbon stored in peatlands while using them for agriculture

Here is how these three types of sustainable farming will work together in a climate restoration oriented food system 

1. Regenerative agriculture is used to produce food on normal agricultural land

2. Regenerative aquaculture is used to produce food in the oceans 

3. Plaudiculture is used to produce food on peatlands  

Enhanced rock weathering is performed on regenerative farmed land. It will not be performed in plaudiculture because enhanced rock weathering is damaging to peat soil. Mining waste alone will not be enough to satisfy the demand for basalt for enhanced rock weathering so therefore the mining of basalt using high capacity mining machinery (bucket wheel excavators, bucket chain excavators, walking draglines) will be needed.  

Animals products is still be produced in this food system. Livestock feed is produced using regenerative agriculture and plaudiculture. Cattle feed has algae mixed into it to reduce methane production. All livestock manure is used to produce renewable natural gas (RNG) via anaerobic digestion. The digestate produced from anaerobically digesting livestock manure is turned into bio-crude oil and then injected back into oil deposits as a way to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. 

All agricultural residues are co-converted into bioenergy (drop-in biofuels, RNG, or district heat) and biochar. This biochar is used as a soil amendment so that it can remove atmospheric CO2 and increase the fertility of agricultural soil. The thermochemical conversion technologies that can co-convert residual biomass can (and should) be self powered by combusting a fraction of either the products produced by the process or the feedstock biomass. 

Do you have any suggestions for other types of farming that could be used in a climate restoration oriented food system? Let me know in the comments. ",21,4,2024-09-18 08:19:19,en,ClimateOffensive

Companies like OpenAI have the explicit goal of creating Artificial Superintelligence which we will be totally unable to control or understand. Massive data centers are contributing to accelerated climate collapse. And job loss alone will completely upend humanity and could cause mass hunger and mass suicide.

On Thursday, I joined a group called StopAI to block a road in front of what are rumored to be OpenAI’s new offices in downtown San Francisco. We were arrested and spent some of the night in jail.

I don’t want my family to die. I don’t want my friends to die. I choose to take nonviolent actions like blocking roads simply because they are effective. Research and literally hundreds of examples prove that blocking roads and disrupting the public more generally leads to increased support for the demand and political and social change. 

Violence will never be the answer.

1fgowr1,A “populist” climate policy,"Right now, there is a lot of pushback against climate policy given downstream effects on everyday consumers and blue collar workers. High gas prices will doom a presidential incumbent, and right wingers can claim to be for the little guy by championing cheap fossil fuel energy.

How do we combat this? Well we can adopt a populist climate policy that marries populist concerns with greenhouse gas reduction by being strategic about framing and the kinds of policies that are spearheaded.

1.) Require all luxury cars, sports cars, private jets, cruise ships, and yachts to use sustainable aviation fuel, green hydrogen, or be battery electric powered. This will make elites subsidize R&D for green transportation. For private jets, there would be an explicit exception for organ transport.

2.) Require all mansions above a certain acre size to have solar panels AND battery backups proportional to acres.

3.) Given the right’s embrace of tariffs, we should rebalance tariffs by removing some and replacing them with a carbon tariff. The MAGA crowd can’t complain about the economics of this because they themselves love tariffs.

4.) Cut red tape and NIMBY regulations for building out infrastructure for solar, wind, transmission lines, housing, public transit, high speed rail, and batteries. ",18,1,2024-09-14 11:39:46,en,ClimateOffensive

Over the past decade, the practice of assigning legal rights to rivers, lakes, and mountains, etc. has increased in hopes of protecting natural ecosystems from environmental harm.

Examples among many include:

* The Māori tribe in New Zealand won recognition for the Whanganui river as a living entity and an ancestor with legal rights. (2017)
* The Yurok tribe in now Northern California in United States assigned personhood to the Klamath River (a dam from which is now being removed). (2019)
* The Innu First Nation tribe in Canada won legal personhood for the Mutuhekau Shipu/""Magpie River"". (2022)
* \[Info retrieved from a Google search and reading a few news articles, please do correct me if any of this info is incorrect.\]

From my understanding, the premise is that natural elements are living entities and inherently deserve the right to exist and flourish, similar to fundamental human rights. Violations of the rights of these ecosystems with legal rights or personhood would be subject to legal proceedings.

There is some debate around this topic, whether it is impactful at all and what the implications of assigning legal rights are. However, what I'm interested is learning of whether there are any communities (local or activist or other) that are **still actively** campaigning to assign legal rights to a specific natural ecosystem. My intention is to learn more about the sociocultural and psychological experiences of these communities in their ongoing efforts. Do you know of any such ongoing campaigns?

1erh4d1,Planning a climate festival in a small UK city,"Hi all,

Our city has recently run a climate jury of which I was selected for, the process was really enjoyable and since the process has officially finished a few of us have decided to see what else we can achieve. Anyway the process culminated in us providing 24 recommendations for the council and wider city to try to achieve, one of these was using the power of community to act as a catalyst for bringing about change with a sub-recommendation of organising a climate festival.

The council has agreed that it is a good idea (many people from the council had already been bouncing the idea around) and are going to give us support in organising the festival.  Their events team will be providing support so we won't have to do all the heavy lifting like finding a venue etc but the council wants the community and residents to be heavily involved in deciding what events will be going on in and around the festival. 

  
I am looking for inspiration as for what kind of events/stalls we could try and put together that would help to raise peoples awareness and change peoples feelings from ""I acknowledge climate change but feel powerless against it"" to something more like ""I feel like if we work together we can make a difference"".

If any of you have been to a similar event and seen something that has helped change peoples opinions then comment below!",2,0,2024-08-13 15:40:42,en,ClimateOffensive

1egi6xc,The eco-friendly meat alternatives for a sustainable lifestyle,"Everybody is familiar with how crucial clean energies such as solar and wind are for mitigating the disasters of global warming. However, with the agriculture sector producing nearly a quarter of global emissions, it is imperative to also consider the vital help of plant-based meats in living a sustainable lifestyle.

* Firstly, let’s consider: why is the production of meat so bad for the environment?
   * Some of nature’s carbon “sinks” are trees and soil, which store carbon dioxide inside them, thus clearing up the atmosphere from greenhouse gases. However, with farming animals comes the destruction of these forests to make way for farmlands, unfortunately releasing the carbon stored inside the trees and into the atmosphere.
   * Second is the use of fertilisers. An obvious need of managing animals on a farm is to feed them, with the food being grown by fertilisers which emit greenhouse gases.
   * Finally, a massive source of climate change is the creation of methane from cattle. When cow manure decomposes under low-oxygen conditions, it emits methane. Therefore, when cows are trapped tightly together and produce manure, the greenhouse gas is released.
* So what could possibly help us take care of our environment without having to give up the cravings of our carnivore diet? Enter plant-based meat.
   * Plant-based meat is food created from plants, which aims to taste, look and feel like the natural meat from an animal. It is created as an alternative to meat, helping environmentally cautious carnivores switch to low-carbon food without giving up their favourite meals!
   * Some popular foods include tofu, made from soya beans and water; seitan, created by wheat gluten and water; and jackfruit, a large tropical fruit originating from Asia.
* Here are some examples of meat alternative products I found on the internet:
   * Beyond Meat plant-based burger patties
      * Beyond Meat offer a burger alternative with their patties containing 21g of protein made from pea, rice and lentils.
   * Eat Meati classic steak
      * Eati Meati’s steak contains 17g protein, with their company making their products from mycelium or the root structure of mushrooms.
   * Daring Foods plant chicken wings
      * Daring Foods plant chicken wings are yet another substitute to meat, having 9g protein, and coming in a plain format on which any sauce of choice may be used.

If you'd like suggestions for a low-carbon diet, check out my web app [Jeebz Food Emissions (food-emissions.com)](https://www.food-emissions.com/), which calculates the carbon footprint from your food, and recommends a more eco-friendly diet.",30,1,2024-07-31 04:43:10,en,ClimateOffensive

1ef26ps,Christianity's Armageddon Conspiracy is Our Climate's Worst Nightmare,"Hello there, my name is Adam, and I've been dedicating myself to saving the environment by eating sustainably, going waste-free, and reducing my emissions. I have also been doing activism work by placing informative stickers around my city to educate people about the state of our climate crisis and create a sustainable future that lasts for ages to come. I’ve become very passionate about climate change and the environment over the years, so sharing my perspective and insights with you is an honour.

I want to raise some concerns that I’ve had after reading the results of a survey that questioned people about climate change and the end of the world. The survey questioned people from different religious backgrounds to obtain information on the beliefs of people who believe in Christianity and the apocalypse. I'm mentioning this because I feel that it is particularly relevant to our climate and one of our world’s most famous climate scientists, Katherine Hayhoe, because she is an evangelical Christian trying to reconcile Christianity with the climate crisis.

The survey found that 39% of Americans believe the end of the world is nigh and that Christians are 22% less likely than those of other religions to think that climate change is a very serious problem. Highly involved religious people were also 30% less likely to think it was a serious problem than those less involved. Despite this, nearly 75% of Americans display Christmas trees each year.

Now, I want to be quite straightforward in distinguishing between the type of Christian Katherine is and others because I see her passion for the environment and climate. She is among the higher percentages of Christians in terms of ethics and altruism. That being said, I do believe that this religion itself is in some ways responsible for this climate denial and is holding her back. My reason for thinking this is because of the Armageddon conspiracy that exists within the Bible. It's a prophecy, and it's supposedly given by the greatest man to have ever lived. We are also expected to take the bible's word for it, even though the Bible has many verses within it that are quite barbaric or, at the least, quite confusing.

For example, the verse where God asked Abraham to sacrifice his son as a test of faith sounds more like a psychopathic gang initiation than a benevolent test of faith to me. Moreover, according to the Bible, the world ends in a chaotic state of disarray and division rather than a peaceful, unified acceptance of our fate as a general collective.

Due to these bad verses, I don’t personally believe Jesus and God are the ultimate exemplary role models of holiness and perfection. I think the Bible is outdated and cannot provide a sufficient moral foundation to develop us to be our highest ethical selves.

I feel that this must be confronted because even Katherine herself wonders what went wrong with her fellow Christians and still wishes that they can all do better. In fact, of all the sects that were covered in the study, Katherine's sect, Evangelicals, were the most likely to think environmental regulations would cause a gradual loss of individual freedoms and that the US would overreact to global climate change by creating many unnecessary environmental regulations. She also mentions that we cannot stop the crisis by simply driving fear into people. We must give them hope of a desirable future as well.

So, I think it's time for us to create a call to action for people like Katherine and even non-believers who put up Christmas trees because I believe people's involvement in Christian traditions seriously impacts our climate when we are unable to bring a proper discussion and discourse about the bible's lack of an end game to the general public.

If we fail to do this, people will go through the motions of adapting to the climate crisis rather than mitigating the issues because they feel there is no hope. They must confront their cognitive dissonance and come to a logical conclusion for themselves and the environment. After all, in the words of Martin Luther King Jr., ""change is not inevitable."" We must work for justice together.

I genuinely feel that Christians should be quite concerned about the bad verses in the Bible and its insistent belief that the world will end because it also makes people contemptuous and defiant of ethics. I actually *do* believe there is a benevolent higher power, which is the force that gives us our dreams at night. Since making changes to my life, I could have tons of dreams at night, as many as 11 in one night and even well over 1000 in a year. I'm not mentioning this to brag, I'm mentioning this because I also believe it's apparent that these true gods or spiritual forces that exist within our lives will only extend themselves to those who are understanding and live ethically.

From what I have learned in my life, the architect of my dreams is, in a sense, like a judge who determines if I'm worthy of their rewards. This is very important because, without this ability to extend or withdraw support, it'd be very difficult to convince me to make such sacrifices for the climate and go the extra mile for my community rather than just doing the bare minimum. Therefore, I believe that the only way we can end the climate crisis is to rely on this power and help others access it. After all, there were times when I was careless and destructive to the environment, so I believe this force is a secret weapon that can give us hope of persuading some of the most ignorant of climate deniers.

So, although it is true that I don’t believe that Jesus or the biblical God are good enough to deserve a religion based on the scriptures as a whole, I still have an astoundingly strong connection with my higher power and dreams that reaffirms some of my concerns with them and the church. Whether Katherine sees things as I do or not, I think it would be very positive for her to publicly reject this idea of an apocalypse because, at the end of the day, she has a lot of rapport with Christians. She could potentially bypass their large latitudes of rejection, which cause people to dismiss many valid concerns with Christianity due to the strong attitudes that have been instilled in them over generations of Christian fundamentalist worship.

Therefore, I think we should brainstorm ideas that could help end this Armageddon conspiracy and make a plan to confront people about their cognitive dissonance regarding these stunning revelations. We should also contact Katherine to see if she's willing to provide an answer to this moral dilemma. What do you think?

1edk2bn,"The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 900 pg pdf ""Mandate for Leadership"" quotes about climate change and the deregulation of the EPA. Please share. (And please mention to the leaders of the larger climate subs to allow text body posts) ","Here are the quotes from ""Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise"" that might concern environmentalists, along with page numbers, explanations and potential issues:

1. **Back to Basics in the EPA**:
   - **Quote**: ""EPA’s structure and mission should be greatly circumscribed to reflect the principles of cooperative federalism and limited government. This will require significant restructuring and streamlining of the agency... EPA should build earnest relationships with state and local officials and assume a more supportive role by sharing resources and expertise, recognizing that the primary role in making choices about the environment belongs to the people who live in it.""
   - **Page**: 420
   - **Explanation**: This approach suggests a reduction in the EPA's regulatory authority, shifting more responsibility to state and local governments. Historically, federal oversight has been crucial in maintaining consistent environmental standards across states, preventing a ""race to the bottom"" where states might lower standards to attract business. Reducing federal oversight could lead to less stringent environmental protections, potentially increasing pollution and environmental degradation.

2. **Reduction in EPA’s Size and Scope**:
   - **Quote**: ""Cutting EPA’s size and scope will deliver savings to the American taxpayer. Improved transparency will serve as an important check to ensure that the agency’s mission is not distorted or coopted for political gain.""
   - **Page**: 446
   - **Explanation**: The proposal to reduce the EPA's size could lead to fewer resources and less capacity to enforce environmental laws. Historically, cuts to environmental enforcement have often led to increased pollution incidents and reduced compliance with environmental regulations. This could particularly impact communities already burdened by pollution.

3. **Critical View of the EPA’s Climate Agenda**:
   - **Quote**: ""Embedded activists have sought to evade legal restraints in pursuit of a global, climate-themed agenda... The EPA under the Biden Administration has returned to the same top-down, coercive approach that defined the Obama Administration. There has been a reinstitution of unachievable standards designed to aid in the 'transition' away from politically disfavored industries and technologies and toward the Biden Administration’s preferred alternatives.""
   - **Page**: 418-419
   - **Explanation**: This criticism suggests a move away from stringent climate regulations. Historically, environmental regulations have played a crucial role in reducing emissions and mitigating climate change. Loosening these regulations could lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and hinder efforts to address global warming, exacerbating environmental problems.

4. **Energy Sector Policies**:
   - **Quote**: ""Opposition from 'Keep it in the ground' environmentalists has made it harder to gain approvals for natural gas pipelines. Under Democrat leadership, FERC has proposed official policies to consider upstream and downstream GHG emissions from the use of the natural gas that would be shipped in the pipeline to be part of FERC’s public-interest determination when deciding whether to approve a pipeline.""
   - **Page**: 407
   - **Explanation**: The resistance to considering full lifecycle emissions in pipeline approvals could lead to underestimating the environmental impact of fossil fuel infrastructure. This could result in more projects that contribute significantly to climate change being approved, counteracting efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

5. **Critique of the Biden Administration’s Environmental Policies**:
   - **Quote**: ""As a consequence of this approach, we see the return of costly, job-killing regulations that serve to depress the economy and grow the bureaucracy but do little to address, much less resolve, complex environmental problems.""
   - **Page**: 418
   - **Explanation**: Labeling environmental regulations as ""job-killing"" and bureaucratic could justify rolling back crucial protections. Historically, such rollbacks have led to increased pollution and public health issues. The focus on economic costs without addressing the long-term benefits of environmental regulations could undermine efforts to safeguard public health and ecosystems.

These quotes highlight a shift towards reducing federal environmental oversight and regulation, emphasizing economic concerns over environmental protections. This approach could lead to weakened environmental standards, potentially exacerbating pollution and climate change issues. Historically, federal environmental regulations have played a crucial role in preventing pollution and protecting public health, and reductions in these areas have often led to increased environmental degradation and health risks.

Information is either transmitted or it is received. Nowadays through various mediums. It seems to me a lot of this everyday information ""noise"" is highly anecdotal, and certainly we live in an age of information overflow that is simply too much for anyone to process in its entirety.

What I wanted to say is that different groups of people have different levels of knowledge on the topic, and that has relevance for both receiving and transmitting information. Granted, nobody has the capability of seeing the future but arguably there are better and worse sources for information. People's background in assessing information matters. People will be swayed by different arguments. Many people simply live in the moment and don't see very far beyond the closest of acquaintances.

I don't really have much confidence in humanity's ability to grasp the most essential information (at least not very quickly, even measured in years or decades) since we're such a varied bunch of people, and people value information on such different grounds. Admittedly I've certainly subscribed previously to information that I myself consider just shameful by my standards today.

Considering all of the above - and the basic facts and statistics about the situation of decarbonization - I don't exactly think we are headed for a bright future. On the other hand I see risks of climate change as a sliding scale and it's not the first (or probably the last) time humans would die en-masse. Do you think things can suck and still be ok at the same time? I do. For all of humanity's failures, we carry on and we adapt - even if later than would be optimal and in different numbers than before.

I've certainly at times felt a distinct skepticism of humanism running over me - and I still consider myself a skeptic of humanism - in terms of absolute agency of humans and what it leads to. But I think we all need to come to terms with what humanism means, and how much we can influence it.

What are your thoughts on the future and the level we can influence it?",5,11,2024-07-13 15:02:28,en,ClimateOffensive

1dydamg,The environmental cost of GPS,"Hey everyone,

This is something I’ve been thinking about for a while now and wanted to share. In our tech-crazy world, we often ignore the environmental costs of our gadgets and services. One big issue that doesn’t get talked about enough is the environmental impact of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) like GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou.

These GNSS providers have a bunch of satellite (24 to 30+ each). And yeah, they’re convenient, but they’re also really bad for the environment...

1. **Building the Satellites**: The materials needed for these satellites (metals, rare earth elements, etc.) are mined and processed in ways that seriously mess up our planet. It’s energy-intensive and often destroys local ecosystems.

2. **Launching Them**: Each rocket launch spews out a ton of CO2 and other pollutants. A single launch can release between 100 and 300 tons of CO2. That’s a huge contribution to climate change.

3. **Running Them**: The ground stations and control centers for these satellites use a ton of electricity. Even if some use renewable energy, the overall carbon footprint is still pretty big.

4. **Dealing with Old Satellites**: When satellites reach the end of their life, they either get moved to a “graveyard” orbit or are made to re-enter the atmosphere. Both options add to space junk or atmospheric pollution.

Given all this, we really need to think about our dependence on GNSS tech. Sure, it’s convenient, but the environmental cost is way too high. If we start rejecting the use of GNSS, we can push providers and policymakers to consider more eco-friendly alternatives. This could mean fewer satellites getting launched in the future.

We can’t keep turning a blind eye to the environmental impact of our tech. It’s time to put the planet’s health above our gadgets. Let’s push for innovations that don’t destroy our ecosystems.

Is using a map really that bad?

1dx1xnp,"Combating the root issue: Technology is not the solution, it's the cause ","I know the first responses to this statement might be to refute it by stating, “no it’s capitalism!” or “no, it’s the evil doers whose hands the technology are in!” I am not here to argue that these are not indeed part of the problem, but they are not the full picture.   
  
Most everyone here has a desire to see nature prosper. We are aware of the damage that our Earth is suffering under the amount of pollution, carbon emissions, exploitation and land being used for industry and we want to do something about it! But most environmental solutions consist of either political reform (i.e. getting rid of capitalism) or advocating for green energy (i.e solar, wind, etc.). But none of these solutions deals with the problem directly: that being technological progress. These solutions might slow down the negative impact that industry is having on the planet, but they will not prevent it. This is because technological progress is antithetical to the prosperity of nature. Any system that supports technological advancements, will inevitably contribute to ecological destruction. When I speak of technology I am not referring to just individual tools or machines like a computer, I am referring to our globalized interconnected technological system in which modern machines rely on to function. To maintain large-scale complex technological structures today requires a **ton** of energy.

For instance, to support the Internet requires the large scale electric grid, data centers, subsea cables, which all use fossil fuels. Even infrastructures like so-called “green” energy such as solar and wind whose structures require rare metals, and a lot of land mass to provide enough energy to our society, disrupting wildlife habitats. I think it’s naive to believe that we could ever invent an alternative energy source that can support our technological world that does not inadvertently negatively impact the environment. Unless we were to scale back on technology would we also scale back on energy consumption; but the more complex a technology is the more power and resources is required to maintain it. Political reform is a hopeless solution. Politicians are biased towards supporting technological progress, and are more concerned about short-term power than they are long-term survival due to global competition. This is why there is such a reluctance to stop using fossil fuel energy all together. There may be a transition in adding more “green” energy to the electric grid, but higher polluting practices will continue to be used because they are a more reliable, efficient and cost-effective means to sustaining our technological system.

“No matter how much energy is provided, the technological system always expands rapidly until it is using available energy, and then it demands still more.” - *Anti-Tech Revolution Why and How,* by Theodore Kaczynski 

While this could be attributable to capitalism, I argue that capitalism has become the dominant economic system *because* of its association with technological and industrial success especially when it comes to short-term survival. Nations that make maximum possible use of all available resources to augment their own power without regard for long-term consequences will become more dominant. It is technology that has made possible the extensive extraction of resources. One only has to observe advancements in oil drilling to see that. I think it’s time we start to think more critically of technological progress and what it means for our planet.

1dvvecz,Suggestions for what YOU can do to fight climate change (comments/help/suggestions wanted!) ,"Hi guys,

Let me know if this isn't the best channel to post this in. Appearently is too political for r/climatechange.

I've seen a lot of posts in multiple channels on what one can do to fight against climate change. I think that the actions you find in those responses vary a lot in how much money and time it would take to do them.

Some people have a lot of time and money on their hands, and I want those people to know that they can do a lot more than simply voting for something environmentally friendly. And some people have just enough money to get by, and I would like those people to also know that they also have a moral obligation to do something, and they can. Everyone needs to contribute here.

I also took some inspiration from DND alignment system. Just to make it a bit more personalized.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or comments. I want to improve this a bit.

1doky4w,Marine Plastic Bioremediation could completely reverse global warming within a decade,"So I just graduated from my BS in Computer Science, and while I was there I did a project for the Clean Energy Ambassador's Network, on marine plastic bioremediation using genetically modified mycoplankton. The biology professors were all really impressed with my project and wanted me to come back to do a PhD in biology and do my proposed project for my phd thesis. The thing is that that would take forever, and I would like to try to find a way to make this happen without having to do a PhD program to do it.

  
So historically, before humans ever showed up or a single tree was ever cut down, between 85%-95% of carbon capture and photosynthesis on the planet was done by phytoplankton. It's currently estimated by the UN that because of microplastics and over whaling, the oceans are only accomplishing about 0.1%-0.01% of the carbon capture and photosynthesis they're capable of, but they're still doing about 70% on the planet. 

  
Conventionally the way carbon capture and photosynthesis in the ocean works, is that whales dive down to eat krill and such, and kick up sediment full of phytoplankton from the ocean floor into the photozone. The photozone is the clearest region of water in the ocean, in which about 90% of photosynthesis and carbon capture occurs. Historically the photozone was about 14 feet deep, but because of microplastics, has been reduced to 8 millimeters. Also we have 1/1000th the number of whales we had historically. 

  
There are already three types of plankton, zooplankton (animal), phytoplankton (plant), and mycoplankton (fungi). Mycoplankton is unique because as far as we can tell, mycoplankton actually begins in freshwater streams and riverbeds and eventually makes its way down to the ocean, so even if something happened that caused wiped out the mycoplankton population in the ocean, it would eventually be restored by the sources in freshwater. 

  
Now there are already edible fungi which eat plastic, and the gene that allows them to do this has been isolated. There are also plankton with the genes for red and blue bioluminescence, the two wave lengths of light phytoplankton need to photosynthesize. The idea is to put these 3 genes in mycoplankton along with gene drive.  This would allow the mycoplankton to change the potential energy in the plastic and oil in the ocean into light energy for the phytoplankton to use to photosynthesize, while the zooplankton would also be able to eat the mycoplankton, allowing for all that potential energy in the plastic in the oceans to go back into the oceans' food web.  This would allow the phytoplankton to capture enough carbon to reverse climate change, and also allow the zooplankton to feed the food web and restore it so that when the plastic is all removed from the oceans, the normal carbon capture cycle would be repaired able to take over.

My personal view is that to beat this, we need to

1) curb emissions by pivoting to clean energy sources, and 
2) create innovative solutions like new energy sources, decarbonisation, PtX, etc.
3) keep society from collapsing/societal unrest in the meantime, which I fail to see would not become a huge risk in a degrowth scenario, which is basically humanity being in a recession forever.

But I'd like to do that in the most ethical way that I can. Now, many people have told me, ""If you care so much about the environment, just dump everything into a broad index fund and donate some of the profits to an environmental group"". While there is a certain logic to that, I just can't make peace with the idea of profiting from oil companies. So I've been tinkering for the past few years, and I think I finally have a long-term green portfolio that I'm happy with, which I'll list below. I am FAR FROM a financial expert, so I'm not suggesting anyone copy my portfolio. But I'd be happy to have a discussion with others who have been thinking about this topic; maybe we'll all learn something. So here's what I'm working with these days:

90% in ETFs that have an A rating on [Fossil Free Funds](https://fossilfreefunds.org/) and 10% in individual stocks that have some sort of positive environmental impact (about 1% each). I also have an emergency fund and some money in lower-risk bonds, but I'm considering those as a separate pool of money for purposes of this discussion.

The ETFs:

VanEck Environmental Services (EVX)

Vanguard Health Care (VHT)

Vanguard Communication Services (VOX)

Nuveen ESG Large-Cap Growth (NULG)

Vanguard Real Estate (VHQ)

The Stocks:

Albemarle (ALB) - lithium

NextEra Energy (NEE) - solar

Nucor (NUE) - recycling

Ormat Technologies (ORA) - geothermal

The carbon calculator assesses the environmental impact of one’s daily activities and helps them identify areas where they could reduce their carbon footprint.  
  
The app also gives recommendations based on actions, such as switching to renewable energy sources, minimizing waste, opting for sustainable transportation, etc. App users have been able to significantly reduce their energy consumption, lower their monthly utility bills, and decrease their overall carbon emissions.  
  
Now here’s a tangibility that I’d pay for. Being able to track progress over time and set goals for reducing newer emissions is a fantastic way to gamify one’s sustainable journey.  
  
Would you? I’m interested in learning if you’ve heard of a carbon footprint tracker, or ever a carbon calculator?  
  
If yes, would you include it in your daily life? Do you think these calculators miss some important aspects, such as how we or corporations can reduce their environmental impact?

There is some debate about the meaning of this song, but let's assume the obvious: it is about ""the end of the world"".  My impression from the song is a dystopian stream of consciousness reflecting a world trying to come to grips with reality.  More like ""the end of rational thought"" versus ""the end of existence"". 

I think it is fair to say that we have missed the 1.5 degree C target that would have avoided extensive climate related problems.  But it's not the end of our existence, not yet.  

I've kept a log of climate related news stories from the last few weeks - the links are below.  This is bad, but it is not actually dystopian.  For new humans this is their new normal.  **We need to keep fighting for the best possible outcome for future generations.**  As individuals we should **feel fine** if we are doing everything that we can do, and do even more when we can.

1d2pfik,I'm working on a petition. Thoughts? Any and all feedback is welcome!,"### Petition to Transition All Government Vehicles to Electric Vehicles to Combat Climate Change 

**To [Government Entity/Official],** 

We, the undersigned, urge the [government entity, e.g., Federal Government, State Governments, Local Governments] to take immediate action in transitioning all government-owned vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs). Given the urgency of the climate crisis, it is crucial for our government to lead by example in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 

### Supporting Arguments:
1. **Environmental Impact**:
   - Government vehicles constitute a significant portion of the vehicles on the road. Transitioning these to electric vehicles will substantially reduce emissions, contributing to cleaner air and a healthier environment.
   - EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, which means less pollution in our communities. 

2. **Economic Benefits**:
   - Though the initial investment in EVs may be higher, the long-term savings on fuel and maintenance costs are significant.
   - Electric vehicles can be powered by renewable energy sources, reducing dependency on fossil fuels and enhancing energy security. 

3. **Leadership and Innovation**:
   - By adopting EVs, the government will demonstrate leadership in combating climate change and encourage the private sector to follow suit.
   - This initiative can spur technological innovation and growth in the EV market, creating jobs and promoting sustainable economic development. 

4. **Health Benefits**:
   - Reducing vehicle emissions can decrease the incidence of respiratory diseases, heart conditions, and other health issues caused by air pollution.
   - A cleaner environment contributes to the overall well-being of the population. 

### Call to Action:
We call on the [government entity] to:
1. Develop and implement a plan to transition all government vehicles to electric vehicles **immediately, with a significant percentage transition (e.g., 50%) within the next 2 years and complete transition within 3-5 years**.
2. Allocate necessary funds and resources to support this transition.
3. Establish partnerships with EV manufacturers and charging infrastructure providers to ensure a smooth and efficient transition.
4. Provide incentives for government agencies to adopt EVs and offer training programs for employees on the benefits and use of electric vehicles. 

### Conclusion:
By transitioning to electric vehicles immediately, the government can take a bold step toward mitigating climate change, protecting public health, and fostering a sustainable future for all. We urge immediate action to ensure a cleaner, greener, and healthier world for current and future generations.

1chrm9q,How did the book 'Silent Spring' have such an impact?,"In the 1960s, Rachel Carson released the book *Silent Spring*, warning about the dangers of pesticides (particularly one called DDT) and their effects on wildlife and nature. The impact of this book caused the US to radically change its agricultural policies, and generally it seems to be considered one of the earliest victories of the environmental movement. I've heard Carson called a pioneer who was vastly ahead of her time, and her book be considered second to Darwin's *On The Origin of Species* in terms of how important it's been to the scientific world.

I haven't myself read the book, although I expect I will one day. What I want to know though is, how did one single book manage to make this much difference, cause such massive changes in policy and go down in history to this extent? I can't imagine any writer, no matter how important and well-presented their points, managing that nowadays. Did politicians in the sixties care more? Did regular folk put more pressure on? Was there less corporate lobbying? Did Rachel Carson have powers of persuasion that have never been seen since? Or was it actually that there was already enough awareness of what she was talking about to change policy, and her book was just in the right place at the right time to solidify that?

I feel like this is something that should be talked about. It's so inspiring that the book *Silent Spring* inspired such huge improvements to environmental policy, and I want to work out how it did to see if that could be replicated again.",16,11,2024-05-01 13:16:59,en,ClimateOffensive

1cdxr7f,I Think We Need A War Time Effort To Combat The Climate Crisis.,"
I can understand the panic surrounding climate change, especially amongst my generation. As someone who's part of Gen Z, it's hard not to feel doom and gloom when looking at the current pace of transition to renewable energy. I'm no scientist, but I've read about the history of ambitious projects like the space race and wartime mobilization. 

It seems clear to me that one of the main reasons the green transition is happening too slowly is a lack of large-scale government investment and support and pushback from big corporations. When nations put their full economic might behind goals in the past, like reaching the moon, they were able to achieve tremendous progress in just a few short years. 

Some say we're already in a crisis with climate change, so why aren't we treating it with the same urgency as we did with World War II? If we organized our society and poured resources into renewable technology on that kind of scale, I really believe we could make huge strides towards meeting the goals laid out in the Paris Agreement. 

Of course, there are no easy answers and switching our entire energy system overnight would be incredibly difficult. But it seems the longer we delay serious action and investment in climate solutions, the worse off future generations like mine will be. I can't help but feel we need to muster the collective will to declare something like a ""war on climate change"" and start mobilizing all of society's resources toward protecting our planet.

* AB 2256 - setup a commission to regularly consider issues for low income energy customers

* AB 2054 - prohibit a member of the CPUC from being employed by an entity subject to regulation by that commission for 10 years after they leave the CPUC

* AB 3118 - make solar energy the official state energy of California

* SB 1374 - allow farmers, multi family buildings, and schools to use solar energy which they produce on their property

* SB 938 - prohibit private utilities from using rate payer funds to lobby. Also setup a zero-emission equity fund which is funded by fines resulting from this bill. The fund focuses on helping low income households transition to lower emission appliances

I wanted to share a student campaign that I and fellow students are leading at Cornell University – it's called the ""What's the Plan?"" campaign, and it's all about pushing for climate action plans in high-risk cities across the U.S.

We are seeking to promote the adoption of climate action plans in cities that are most at risk from the impacts of climate change and we are also working to raise awareness about Climate Action Plans through social media. Our focus has been on getting university students involved. But we would love support from a wider group of people who are interested in the issue.

Our campaign is using all the digital tools at our disposal to make it super easy for us to get involved. We have made pre-drafted emails to send to our elected officials, petitions to sign, and even creating and sharing our own content on social media to spread the word. We also have created data visualizations to better explain the issue. 

You can find out more about the ""What's the Plan?"" campaign on their website here, or check them out on social media:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The inconvenient truth is environmental justice warriors are caught up in a vicious cycle of ignorance because action without thought based upon ""scientific understanding"" is impulsiveness.

1by6iue,A debate - My view is the main climate action we should do is get involved in politics. Thoughts?,"I’m going to argue here that the best, most effective and most urgent climate action we can take part in is politics. This is a positive action you can take and it is something you can do daily, weekly. monthly and more. As we all have a set amount of time/money we can put into action, I’m arguing this is the best place for it.

A few caveats before I start on the why and how of my argument here.

*First* does not need to be the only thing you do, if you’re doing other things and they are working for you, great, I am also going to say it is work putting some time into politics. If you’ve got limited free time because of work/family etc - this is IMHO the best place to put energy.

*Second,* I’m assuming as the reader you’re in a political system where you can influence the outcome. The main examples I’ll use here are from Uk and the US as that is what I know about. Would always be interested to read other’s points of view.

*Third*, I’m not saying if you’re not doing what I’m arguing that somehow you’re bad - not at all - if you’re doing something - anything - towards climate solutions that is always better than doing nothing.

OK let’s get into it. It has been apparent that humanity has needed to act for decades on climate. Year after year passes and yet the kind of meaningful global action we need to see does not come to pass. I’m not going to spell out the worrying situation we’re in, as plenty of others do so and very well. Over that time we’ve seen a plethora of different groups, tactics, actions over a range of different countries come to pass and yet nothing meaningful has changed. This is not an implicit criticism of all of those that have gone before, indeed I’ve taken part in plenty of them. It is simply an acknowledgement that the scale of the challenge is huge and getting action done is hard. But at its core, we need governments to act.

This is both a realistic and achievable course of action; as well as the huge rise in renewables, plus the fact that most people favour climate action, there are also solutions that are popular with voters and don’t cost taxpayers money - indeed they save us money - such as removing fossil fuel subsidies.

Our issue is the gap between these solutions and where we are now and what we need in the coming years. That gap is about political will.

How do we close it? 

We can help by making our up-coming climate action political. How? The theory here is pretty basic:

1. Find the next election of note to where you vote - local, national etc.
2. Find the politician there who has both a good chance of winning and who is better on climate issues.
3. Back the better climate candidate to win. This is where you can take meaningful action - volunteer for the campaign, donate to the campaign, advocate for them online and so on. Make sure that they know that your support comes from them having a better climate position than the other possible victor in the race.
4. If they win, keep the pressure up on them to enact promises of climate action by writing to them to remind them of why they had your support. Whenever a big legislative vote on an item of climate legislation is coming up, write to them to ask if they will support it. Write to them to encourage them to go further on climate issues. 
5. While that is happening. find the next election you can vote in. Repeat.
6. When there is no upcoming election - write to your incumbent representative on climate issues, even if they are not great on it, so they know people do care.

That’s it. That’s the strategy.

So I’m based in the UK - next up for us is the local elections on May 2nd. This is for local councils and some other seats like police commissioner and some mayors. Then later in 2024 (no date as yet) will be the national elections where we vote to a Member of Parliament (MPs) and the party with the most MPs goes on to form a government.

***Some notes on it.***

This is not some silver bullet for climate action, I know. It is more like the Atomic Habits version where we’re focused on small but meaningful gains that over time, however they do become bigger and more potent the more we win.

It also means compromises. A lot of it. Politics is about compromise and all too often, picking the lesser of two evils. It is sad but real. It means there will be other issues in the campaign that perhaps you don’t agree with, yes not great, but getting climate solutions enacted is about being pragmatic at this stage.

On what candidates/party? Again, its about being pragmatic. For example, what if there are other candidates/parties who are really good on climate but don’t really have a chance of winning? Sadly I don’t think that is the best place for our energy. We need climate policies enacted now and we need governments who will respond to the inevitable climate disasters by going further on climate action. Which means you need to get people elected first. 

What if there are no candidates talking about climate issues at all? You can go to political town halls and hustings and ask them. Contact the campaigns to ask? Put our climate on the agenda. Still not happening for you? Possibly even join the better climate policy party in your area which has a chance of victory and stand for election, running on climate as ***the*** issue for you.

What about the sense that all politicians are the same and the system seems broken. Totally agree with that sentiment, however there is a huge difference, in climate terms, between a party that will do something and a party that not only denies that the issue exists but will actively aim to make things worse. I’d rather have big ambitious gains on climate policy, but if the alternative is between small gains and denial, I’ll take the small gains.

Ideally if you can find others in the area with the same concerns and act as a group of voters, the better! Plus there are always things you can do in a political campaign from online advocacy to campaign volunteering. One of the best things to offset feeling scared for the future, is to act for a better future - to borrow a slogan; Do More, Worry Less.

(Again, please don’t mean me saying not to worry as much as saying I don’t worry at all - I do - it's just that beyond the point of motivation for action worry can just sap energy and morale.)

1bs8ng5,US House of Representatives votes to reject carbon tax as a solution,"Last week the House voted to approve a resolution condemning a tax on carbon ([House Resolution 86](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/86/text)).  Nearly all the points in the resolution are factually incorrect.  

For example, other countries have already implemented versions of a carbon tax, which make it more expensive for us to sell our product in their country.  Without an equivalent tax here, it is cheaper for other countries to export and sell their high carbon products in the US.  This imbalance can ruin our economy, and allow countries like China to create all of the GHG that they want.

More importantly most scientists and policy makers agree that we need a carbon tax to use our market forces to shift demand to products that are lower in carbon content.  Without it we are literally doomed, there is no way to get to net zero.

Here is the list of representatives and how they voted: [Role Call: House Bill Number 86](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202497?)

CALL TO ACTION:  Harass these mother-fkrs!  Follow Trump’s lead and harass their children.  Warn their grandchildren!  Tell them to get serious about dealing with climate change, or get out of the way.

To be clear, I am not calling for abuse or physical harm.  I am asking for a flood of emails and phone calls to the people standing in the way of action on climate.  I’m asking for protests at their local office.   I’m asking for news coverage.  I’m asking that their ignorance and role in dooming the planet does not go unnoticed.

We only need to convince 20 people to change their vote.  20 people to take a step that may save the planet. Dammit.  We can do this.

1bs3e6i,Increase earth's albedo,"Okay, so first off, I am no college educated scientist however I had an idea recently that I wanted to discuss and see if it may be feasible. My idea is to artificially increase the earth's albedo, that is, how reflective the earth's surface is. I did some searching and found that there were attempts to do so by putting more chemicals into the air but I don't know how I feel about this.  


So my idea is to cover 16,000 square miles of the earth's surface in white cotton with reflective biodegradable/edible sequins sewn into every inch of it. As for where to put this behemoth of a piece of cotton, over the pacific ocean, as oceans don't have a high albedo. I feel like cotton would be the safest and if you put it about 10 feet over the surface with buoys. This would quickly alter the albedo of the planet which would help combat the climate crisis though it may not stop it, it might buy us some time. It could be made larger if desired too and replaced if needed.  


Please what are your thoughts on this idea, could this help, do you have any suggestions to improve the idea and would it even be feasible? Also... sorry if I used the wrong flair/posted in the wrong area.",0,8,2024-03-31 02:05:30,en,ClimateOffensive

1b5wwbo,Can we create a better carbon credit?,"First reddit post. I have been getting frustrated by how useless carbon credits are, but cannot shake the feeling that the free-market system still has a lot of potential to drive society-wide positive climate action. So please consider and critique the following idea I have for a personal carbon credit system. If there is any merit to it, your criticisms will be useful to refine it:

On a global level, climate change is being driven primarily by the extraction of fossilized carbon, and injecting it into the environment. This not only includes the fossil fuel industry, but also petrochemicals, fertilizer manufacturing, etc. Thus, I propose a carbon credit with a twist. **Instead of making carbon credits as a permit for each end user to emit CO2, we make carbon credits as a permit to extract crude oil, coal, and natural gas. Extractors would use these carbon credits to buy a permit from the regulator to extract these resources, and the regulator destroys the credit upon receiving them.**

**How many carbon credits per tonne of coal/oil/gas?**

We already know the chemistry and can calculate exactly how much CO2 is released by fully oxidizing that resource, and that is exactly how many carbon credits the extractor would need. This is the “sink” for these credits.

**What is the “source” of these credits?**

We distribute the carbon credits equally to every person in the jurisdiction where this system is being implemented. We recognize that until we finish the transition, we still require these commodities to live in today’s world, but we also recognize that every person has an equal right to life in this society. Only human persons receive their share, companies/organizations/corporations receive nothing.

**How do these credits make their way from the “source” (individual people) to the “sink” (carbon extractors)?**

The credits act as a parallel currency to the existing national fiat currency system. Participants in the economy would naturally only require these carbon credits if their activities are still coupled to fossil fuels/petrochemicals. For example:

* You buy a bus ticket with money + carbon credits.
* The bus operator buys diesel from the fuel distributor with money + carbon credits.
* The fuel distributor buys diesel from the refiner with money + carbon credits.
* The refiner buys crude oil from the oil driller with money + carbon credits.
* The oil diller buys the permits to continue their operation from the government/regulator with carbon credits.
* The government/regulator destroys the credits.

**How many credits does the regulator create?**

The plan for the quota must meet our climate goals of decoupling from fossil fuels fast enough to prevent as much human suffering as possible, while recognizing that if we constrain our fossil fuel use too early and suddenly, the economic shock can also reduce our ability to transition rapidly and cause immediate harm to people. This must be analyzed by experts on climate science as well as other fields, and updated as our understanding of the situation evolves. It must also be made public knowledge to give people and organizations the information necessary to plan their transition. For example, at the start we can maintain the current trend of fossil fuel extraction to try to minimize economic shock, then gradually reduce the quota over time, accelerating as time progresses until we reach our climate targets at the required deadline.

**What happens if you want/need to consume more than your allowance can afford?**

You can buy them from someone else through an exchange setup by the regulator to facilitate instant and free trading of credits. Key point, you cannot buy them directly from the regulator, the regulator only creates new credits based on the quota and distributes them equally. Thus, to pollute more than your fair share, you must always buy the privilege from someone else who has polluted less than their fair share (either through conscious action, or being unable to afford to consume at that level).

**Some advantages of this system:**

* We have a simple policy tool to set a clear roadmap to achieving the decoupling from fossil fuels, which we can adjust depending on the development of climate science and the progress of the transition.
* We create a tangible and measurable incentive for all levels of society to decouple from fossil carbon. For businesses, decoupling from fossil carbon now can provide a measurable cost advantage for ecological action. For individuals, reducing carbon intensive consumption can bring additional wealth through credits sold.
* We reduce the cost of administering the carbon credit system.  
Existing systems that apply to emissions must account for the intricacies of every form of emissions in our complex economy. For example, the way to calculate emissions for a drinks bottling plant that consumes plastics will be very different from a farm that consumes chemical fertilizers, or an individual driving a petrol powered automobile.  
This system that applies to fossil fuel producers only needs to account for the carbon mass fraction of the raw fossil carbon (coal/oil/gas), and needs to audit a much smaller number of entities (coal miners, oil/gas drillers).
* We create a redistributive mechanism for wealth. Anyone wishing to pollute more than their fair share must do so in exchange for a part of their economic power. Today, we do not price the externalities of emissions, and thus encroach on each other’s right to a safe climate for free. While this is primarily aimed at rewarding people who make environmentally friendly decisions and delivering some justice to people who never had the wealth capacity to cause the climate crisis, it can also be sold to the rich and powerful as a mitigating factor to their outsize emissions.
* We delegate decisions to the local level by letting every economic player determine what is their own best course of action to decouple from fossil carbon, based on their knowledge of their specific context and capabilities.
* Less intrusive on privacy. The government does not need to track and categorize what individuals do or buy to assess their carbon cost. The carbon cost of products is determined by the free market. If a business overprices their products in carbon credits, that cost is directly convertible into a monetary cost that can be used to compare similar offers from competitors.
* Democratic advantage. In a system with unbalanced emissions, it is a mathematical certainty that the people who pollute more will be a minority. Thus the majority will benefit from the redistributive properties of the system, which should be advantageous to politicians to back it in a democratic system.

**Other notes:**

* This system only aims to facilitate the transition away from fossil carbon, and cannot act on its own. It must be used in parallel with other actions to repair the damage we have already done.",10,6,2024-03-03 19:25:08,en,ClimateOffensive

1b1aixa,Championing Walkable Cities,"Last year, I was a Fellow of the Kansas State Walking College, put on by America Walks with funding and support from AARP Kansas.

Over the course of the fellowship, I began to recognize the impressive and cheap climate benefit of designing cities for people instead of cars. Whatever cars there will be in the future should be electric, but the switch should really be from cars to active transportation and transit for most people.

After spending a full year in the climate-adjacent space of urbanism and transportation design (fueled by The War on Cars, Booked on Planning, Reinventing Parking (podcasts); The High Cost of Free Parking, Walkable City, Paved Paradise (books); and media from Strong Towns and the Parking Reform Network (non-profits), I went to visit with my city planner.

We've now been to a Planning Commission meeting and then to a Zoning and Subdivision Committee meeting together, where I presented and argued for a proposal that I wrote, which aims to eliminate minimum parking requirements in our town -- a very important (first) step in making the city one that can be accessed and enjoyed by all modes of transportation. The outcome of all this is still uncertain, but I hope that you might consider reading the proposal and, if you find it agreeable, take up the cause in your city.

Thank you.

1au62cb,I'm trying to shift public perception on a lot of issues. I've decided to start making videos and would love input.,"**(This is targeted to several different subreddits, largely because these issues overlap like crazy and I want perspectives from a ton of people from different backgrounds if possible.)**

&#x200B;

Starting a year ago, I became hyper-aware of, well... a lot of what's going wrong with the world.

&#x200B;

For the past six months, I've been trying to think of ways to actually make a difference as a low-income citizen with zero connections and effectively no social network. The average worker, basically. And as everyone here is well aware, the average worker views themselves as more or less powerless on their own (acting as a collective = the only way forward).

&#x200B;

But I have a few skills that may be helpful to subs and communities like this-- one of them seems to be an obsession with the interconnected nature of the problems discussed here and elsewhere. I want to frame the most significant ones in ways that don't leave you feeling hopeless, in ways that demonstrate progress can be made (and how best to make that progress).

&#x200B;

There are a lot of moving parts, and this post doesn't need to be an essay. To start with, I'm going to build a social media presence that acts as a unifier for discussing tech, socioeconomic dysfunction, the climate crisis and other ecological disasters, and the manipulation occurring in each of those vectors. This will ideally lead to crowdsourcing research, cooperatives, etc. The first content slated for release on social media is a series that I've nicknamed ""The Problem Series"", eight episodes running 45-60 minutes each. Here's where I'd love some input! Let me know what you think of the following topics/premises, whether they accurately portray the biggest problems we're all facing, and if they seem compelling enough to gain traction:

&#x200B;

(Episode titles are intentionally clickbait-ish to accommodate audience demographics, suggest a different order if you strongly feel that a certain sequence of information presentation would be more logical...)

&#x200B;

**1.  Problem #1: Capitalism's Death Spiral:**

Breaks down why the vast majority of human-created issues now stem from unregulated corporate practices. This includes wage stagnation, wealth consolidation, climate change, the plastic/waste crisis, the housing crisis etc. The intent here is to provide an abstract-level overview that will touch on core problems while illustrating their intersection with one another.

&#x200B;

**2. Nobody is an Island: The Myth of Rugged Individualism:**

Drawing on historical analysis, sociological research, and personal narratives, this episode examines the myth of rugged individualism and its role in shaping Western society's values and attitudes. The idea that we should deify those who successfully carve an outsized portion of resources for themselves (the ""self made"" billionaires and friends) is inherently toxic and enables extreme levels of passiveness in general citizenry as we watch a select few bleed us dry.

&#x200B;

**3. Your Landlord is a Robot: Notes on Our Next Housing Crisis:**

The title here takes aim both at the actual AI-driven real-estate bidding wars expected to escalate across the next decade as well as at the current practices of ""human"" landlords running rackets on millions of low-income citizens world-wide. Here, we examine alternatives such as selective applications of communal infrastructure and other collectivist ideals, regulatory measures to eliminate the practices discussed, and other municipality-level approaches that yield more security for at-risk populations.

&#x200B;

**4. Co-op 101: Building a Better Future :**

This episode deviates somewhat from an immediate focus on problems and instead tries to paint an anticipatory picture of what some of our core infrastructure, utilities, and modes of business might look like in a highly-regulated flavor of capitalism (one that leverages the principles of things like ""universal basic utilities""; water/electricity/food are treated as basic human rights in this hypothetical)

&#x200B;

**5. Skepticism 101: Let’s Dissect Corporate (Lies):**

Dedicated to taking aim at corporations and monopolies whose legacy of moral bankruptcy continues to harm everyone outside of a minuscule segment of the global population. The aim is to objectively categorize and examine the strategies used by these entities to persuade citizens to ignore the social, financial, and environmental costs incurred by their self-centered practices; the motives that drive these levels of apathy, and what effective organized responses from those impacted would actually look like.

&#x200B;

**6. Working Until You Die: Income Inequality Explained:**

The title here is pretty self-explanatory imo. The intent is to explore the existing trends tied to retirement and the cost of living, and examine what happens in societies that have eroded their social safety nets-- what happens when you simply cannot afford to age out of your work or become disabled? This absolutely stretches beyond retirement, but it's a very potent image to consider since this has historically been the ""light at the end of the tunnel"" for those below the upper class.

&#x200B;

**7. Every Purchase is Violence: The Real Cost of Consumerism:**

The title may seem hyperbolic until you realize the percentage of the labor/supply chain for consumer goods that are built on outright slavery or extreme animal cruelty. This is another very difficult-to-look-at global phenomenon. But as I mentioned in the intro to this post, I will also deep dive into the lovely handful of companies that are thoroughly pursuing solutions to these issues, and illustrate how other companies can be pressured or convinced to do their part (no, this isn't just boycotting).

&#x200B;

**8. Forever Automated: AI Wants to Replace You at Work:**

More clickbait phrasing, but the crux of it is proving to be exceptionally accurate. We are set to witness the permanent down-sizing of many creative and white collar industries... but we shouldn't be surprised in the least. This episode examines why the writing has been on the wall for centuries when it comes to automating every available function within the workplace, and why objectively different rules apply to the worker displacement seen during the industrial revolution versus the AI and computing revolutions. Remember: if you can describe your jobs as a series of steps, a robot or AI-augmented system can and will take it.

&#x200B;

**9. You, Me, Us : Fighting for Today instead of Tomorrow:**

I have to end it on a high note. This has to be a series that provides some kind of ray of hope for people like me, the ones waking up fucking sad everyday when we think about what the world is turning into. This is the start of a project that proposes to incrementally shift the tracks until our runaway train is diverted onto a safer path. An exit ramp strategy, if you will. This isn't holding hands and singing ""We Are the World"", this is a declaration of organized resistance built on extending compassion and thoughtfulness into structured change.

&#x200B;

10. Thank you for coming to my ted talk

**If literally any of this grabbed your attention, I'd love to hear why, and whether you have more insight in specific areas. Sources, examples, proposals for content. All of it is welcome. If you think it's stupid, cool; I'd love to hear alternative approaches or methods of constructing the beginnings of a grassroots collective.**

&#x200B;

**TLDR; I'm making a video series examining all of the global problems and putting them into a framework to see what existing strategies are missing. Then, running social and economic experiments to test what's actually effective. This will require a shit-ton of crowdsourcing, but I know I'm not the only one looking for something organized that opposes the sea of greedy bullshit we're all wading through.**

1ao13ip,The federal government is offering major tax benefits to local governments that could reduce the cost of procuring electric vehicles.," Hi, I'm a volunteer with the organization ClimateChangemakers and we are  spreading the word on this on social media, hence me posting this.  If you want to get involved just go to [https://www.climatechangemakers.org/](https://www.climatechangemakers.org/) and click on ""join the community"".  We have weekly hours of action you can attend online on either Mondays, Thursdays, or Fridays.  Also there are some in person opportunities as well.  

  
Despite the well-documented [financial](https://afdc.energy.gov/calc/), [health](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/06/health/electric-vehicles-save-nearly-90-000-lives/index.html), and [environmental](https://theicct.org/publication/a-global-comparison-of-the-life-cycle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-of-combustion-engine-and-electric-passenger-cars/)  benefits of electric vehicles, municipalities have lagged in making the  switch from conventional to electric fleets. Think maintenance trucks,  police cars, snow plows, and shuttle buses. This is largely due to high  upfront costs related to vehicle procurement and charging  infrastructure.   
Prior to the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act  (IRA), claiming tax credits was an enormously complex process for local  governments. Because cities and counties are not tax-liable entities,  big banks would claim tax credits on behalf of local governments, and  then pay them less than the value of the credits. Through the IRA, new  “direct pay” allows the federal government to give money directly to  municipalities for doing something it deems a public good (like  decarbonization efforts) instead of making it a tax credit. This makes  local decarbonization projects much more affordable and feasible.   
Constituents  have a role to play in communicating with local elected officials. We  can inform policymakers of the eligibility change with direct pay tax  credits and urge them to invest early in electric municipal fleets. We  can also connect policymakers with helpful resources as they evaluate  which vehicles to electrify and how to reduce costs. ",12,3,2024-02-11 01:04:44,en,ClimateOffensive

Share and sign petition here,"Mountaintop removal coal mining is a destructive practice that devastates our landscapes, contaminates our water, and harms our wildlife. In Tennessee, Hurricane Creek Mining LLC is seeking a permit to mine 650 acres of protected forest - an area that serves as a critical habitat for numerous species and plays a vital role in maintaining the state's ecological balance.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, mountaintop removal mining has been linked to the contamination of hundreds of miles of streams and the destruction of nearly 2,000 square miles of Appalachian forests. This not only threatens biodiversity but also affects local communities who rely on these resources for their livelihoods (source: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency).

This is still not to mention the directly linked effects it has had on human health in a variety of ways. Researchers from more than a dozen universities have concluded that mountaintop removal coal mining contributes to significantly higher rates of birth defects, cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases among individuals living in the region. Ideally, Mountaintop Removal would be banned entirely for its incredibly destructive and overly invasive nature. However, our fight begins with getting new permits blocked and for that we need your help.

We cannot stand by while this continues. We call upon the Tennessee government to deny Hurricane Creek Mining LLC's permit application and protect our precious forests from further harm.

1ajgugo,Big Changes should be made to the Department of Energy.,"Big Changes to the Department of Energy

1. They should own the patents on all the energy projects that they fund. (Make the Department of Energy rich to fund more science and more energy research, and can pay bonuses out to their lab researchers too.)

2. They should collect royalties from all the promising energy projects and patents that they have.

3. The more energy projects that get funded and get completed and get commercialized they should earn royalties and licensing fee upon all these completed energy projects that allows the Department of Energy to make more and more money which would allow them to create more and more energy projects and thus earn more and more royalties and licensing fees and so on and so forth.

4. Therefore the Department of Energy would be like a quasi government and quasi business organization that would be focused on business objectives like efficiency and etc with bringing more and more competition and innovation to energy markets around the world.

5. And they should be audited by outside groups every once in awhile too.

6. Just wanted to add in this note that the National Institute of Health collects royalties based upon their own medical and health research and I really don’t see why the Department of Energy cannot collect its own royalties based upon the amazing science and research they do each day, they have like 20 different laboratories working on so much science and energy research that they would make a ton and I mean a ton of money if they owned all the patents, licenses, and royalties off of it.

7. The Department of Energy could make a ton of money off its energy research and this money could fund a lot more research and tools on how to best solve the issues of climate change as well.

1ads8wb,My company has built liquid/immersion cooling solutions to offset the uptick in emissions brought on by AI & HPC,"I posted this on r/ClimateActionPlan too, wanted it to share it here as well, it's about how tech companies like mine are developing solutions to help other tech companies reduce emissions.  

A bit of background for those of you who might not be aware, the data centers we're all using right now (we're on Reddit, after all) consume a lot of power and generate a lot of carbon--estimated to be on par with the entire aviation industry. With the recent popularity of AI and HPC (high-performance computing, what was traditionally known as supercomputing), data centers are naturally using more power and pumping out more carbon. That's something we cannot rewind the clock on, the genie is out of the bottle. But we can use other high-tech inventions to balance things out.

What the server company I work for is doing is offering our clients new ways to cool their data centers/ servers with the minimum amount of power necessary. There's an index we use in the industry called PUE, or power usage effectiveness. PUE equals overall data center power consumption divided by the power requirement of the processors. In simpler terms, it measures how much additonal power you're using to cool your servers and maintain stable operations. The ideal PUE is 1.0: that is, zero additional power is used to cool the servers. But currently the industry average is around 1.6. This means **60% more** power is used just to run the air conditioning for the servers.

We're trying to change the way the IT sector thinks about thermal management by introducing liquid cooling and immersion cooling solutions, which are more energy-efficient than air cooling. We're not the only ones doing this but we already have sucess stories with the [Japanese telecom giant KDDI](https://www.gigabyte.com/Article/japanese-telco-leader-kddi-invents-immersion-cooling-small-data-center-with-gigabyte?lan=en) and a [major Taiwanese semiconductor company](https://www.gigabyte.com/Article/semiconductor-giant-selects-gigabyte-s-two-phase-immersion-cooling-solution?lan=en). We're helping our customers use liquid coolant to cool their servers, either by running the coolant through tubes into the servers (conventional DLC liquid cooling) or dunking the servers directly into a coolant bath (immersion cooling).

The benefits are twofold. First, liquid/immersion cooling consumes much less power than air conditioning, so we can help our clients improve PUE from the industry average of 1.6 to as low as **1.02** (just 2% more power to cool the servers instead of 60% more power). Second, chips cooled in this fashion can reach a higher TDP ceiling, which means they can achieve max performance without needing to be throttled to prevent overheating. If every chip is giving you max performance, you need fewer chips overall, so your carbon footprint is reduced further.

So for those of you who might be worried about what big tech is doing to balance their carbon emissions, there *is* a solution, it just takes time for this new technology to be more widely adopted. From our case studies you can see that some big global companies are already setting an example for everyone else. You can learn more about effective cooling technologies here ([link](https://www.gigabyte.com/Topics/Advanced-Cooling?lan=en)) if you like. In the immortal words for Douglas Adams, don't panic!

I've been doing some reading up on social movement organisations advocating for climate change (mostly in Europe) and it's clear that they have varying commitments to civil disobedience. I'm curious if anyone knows which organisations are committed to **not** engaging in civil disobedience (e.g., only legal and pre-approved protesting and marches). For example, it's clear that Just Stop Oil (along with other activists from the [A22 network](https://www.climateemergencyfund.org/a22)) explicitly commit to engaging in civil disobedience to raise more urgent awareness of the climate crisis. On the other hand, I've read in some places that Extinction Rebellion UK have committed to refraining from civil disobedience last year in the hope of gathering more public support - I was wondering if you know of more organisations that have made such commitments.

18rpr4s,Buy It For Life (BIFL) movement,"Hey folks,  
First post here. I just wanted to share something that I've gotten really into in the last few years, which is the Buy It For Life (BIFL) movement. If I were to guess, many of you reading this are already members, but there's a pretty thriving subreddit r/BuyItForLife if you'd like to join a community devoted to this concept. The Venn-diagram between climate activists and BIFLs is probably not a complete circle, but it's close.  


Anyway, one of the things that got me into this was a snarky comment from the CEO of Gibson (at the time) James Curleigh. I believe this in 2018 or 2019, pre pandemic for sure. He was being interviewed about a new line of sustainable guitars Gibson was releasing (using sustainable woods and natural finishes). He actually defended the rest of the Gibson line of guitars too by saying that their first sustainable priority was to ""make guitars that people won't want to throw away for a hundred years.""   


When I first heard him say that, I laughed it off. But it started nagging at me that I think he was actually right. I started looking around at all the things I've purchased that definitely had expiration dates for one reason or another. Then I thought back to all the bags of trash I've filled during spring cleanings. All the garbage clothes, furniture, electronics, and kitchenware that just came and went because I just shopped for the cheapest thing possible.   


Now, I shop very deliberatively. I'll make up my mind to buy something long before I pull the trigger on it. Partly to save up for it, and partly to wait for a good deal to come around. I no longer ""shop the deals,"" instead, I wait to see if the deals apply to the things I know I need/want. And I buy things I know I'll be able to get at least 10 years out of, but ideally much longer if I take care of them. I cook with cast iron and carbon steel now mostly instead of nonstick. I've purchased boots that can be repaired when the souls are worn down. I even stopped using the dryer for most clothes and have purchased a drying rack to extend the life of them as much as possible. This year though, my big purchase was a Fjallraven winter jacket that uses their G1000 wax. It was expensive, but in all likelihood this jacket will outlive me. So in the long run, I would've spent the same on jackets that would fall apart after a few years. But it doesn't have to be expensive. A lot of BIFL stuff is dirt cheap, because a lot of it has been around for a LONG time, so long that you might be able to find a lot of it at antique shops or thrift stores.  


I know that this a privilege not afforded to many people who either need things immediately, or cannot afford to buy the quality they'd like. I also know that changing our own consumer spending habits really is just a drop in the bucket for climate impacts. I know that the carbon footprint is a scam made up by fossil fuel think tanks. But it's something, and I think if you have the means and you're not already doing so, I would highly encourage you to consider spending some time exploring the idea. Because its something you can control, and it feels pretty damn good too.",11,7,2023-12-26 21:46:29,en,ClimateOffensive

I find it really helps to write how I'm feeling down, ideally in public so that others can see it. I have my own blog (I won't say what it's called, don't want this to be misconstrued as advertising or self-promotion!) but I find updating it really helps.

18p7w0x,This perspective makes the whole thing seem much more possible,"I've posted this on the threads of a few people who were losing hope, but I thought it was so important that it deserved a whole thread.

I came across a YouTuber talking about hope. She started out by saying that she reads every scientific paper that comes out, she often finds it very depressing and feels like she's losing hope. But, she made the important point that the only reason, particularly as a woman, that she's a) capable of reading in the first place, b) is allowed to access this research and c) has the intelligence to comprehend the information contained within, is because amazing people who existed many generations before she did fought for her right to do those things, even though they knew that they'd never live long enough to meet the people who reaped the benefits.

She went on to say how unbelievably insulting would it be to all those people, who fought for us to have something of a reasonable quality of life today, for her to now sit back and say, 'You know what, I give up, I don't think we can win this one'?

I saw this when I was in a particularly low place and feeling like we were doomed, and it completely turned my attitude around. It reminded me that we don't know what we're capable of until after we've achieved it. That horrible scary feeling, that we've got no chance of being successful, has been felt by so many people in the past, at all sorts of periods throughout history. Everyone who ever achieved something amazing probably had their dark days as well, when they wondered if the fight was worth it. But it was worth it, and it's worth it now as well.

Another important perspective that I saw was from a climate scientist, who said that they find doomers more harmful than denialists these days. Firstly because a lot of what they say isn't even necessarily true from a scientific perspective, but more importantly, on a psychological level, the idea that it's all useless, creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. I agree with this. I can at least understand where deniers are coming from - I think deep down they do know, but they're as frightened as us, and their way of dealing with the problem is pretending it isn't happening. But doomers are not trying to achieve anything - all they're doing is obstructing our ability to find ways of dealing with the situation. If you truly believe that there's nothing to be done, please have the decency to sit quietly, rather than trying to influence others. Because even if in time it turns out that I'm wrong and the doomers are right and we're already WAY beyond the point of no return (I'm not a scientist, but having read as many scientific perspectives as I can I don't believe it's the case) it is STILL better to fight for all it's worth than to throw in the towel. In a worst-case scenario, I don't want to be stuck wondering what might have been if we'd got our act together quicker. I want to know that at least we did everything we could.",52,18,2023-12-23 10:23:28,en,ClimateOffensive

18nmbqz,Why should we renounce flying?,"First of all, I'm not a general opponent of criticism of consumerism. In some cases, it's important to reflect on what we consume, although of course, other measures must be taken, as well.
But what about flying? We hear all the time that we shouldn't fly - but if I cancel my holiday flight, the plane will still take off, right? So the reduction in CO2 is almost non-existent. 

Does not-flying only yield to anything if we are the single person that crosses the threshold for the plain not to take off? Which would mean that in like 95/100 cases, us not flying doesn't do any good?

I hope I missed something and not flying actually does make sense.",15,58,2023-12-21 07:50:56,en,ClimateOffensive

18jqqka,The way we approach climate change is wrong and harmful to society,"This is strongly generelized and not ver specific because i wanna keep myself short.

Todays politicians, activists etc are doing more harm when it comes to climate change, then good.

The right parties and beliefs (i myself lean toward the right political side) straight up ignores the topic, and the left politicians go about it in the wrong way. Same goes for activists.

I studied this topic for years during my years in trade school and held two presentations about in two schools, each took several months of prep, and 6 hours of interesting presentation. I provided many good ideas and solutions, aswell as ways to solve it realistically.

The issue with climate change politics is that its either ignored, or its stated that we need to stop man-made (or artificially accelerated) climate change. This is the wrong way of thinking. We need to work with climate change. Its happening faster then we thought, and our ecosystems (currently mediterranean climate zones are affected stronger) cant adapt fast enough.

Our flora and fauna is dying rapidly because of strong weather extremes and changes, and in order to help it adapt, new plants, previously even considered invasive (some, not all or most) aswell as new animals (first and foremost insects, but not only) need to be introduced and accustomed. We have to reforest and change our woodlands, need to introduce way more flora into our cities and towns, and we have to start building smarter.

We dont have to sacrifice alot, just a tiny bit, of our lifestyle in order to adapt and live alongside nature. The internal combustion engine for one cannot cease to exist yet if we wanna ""fight"" climate change, we need it. And we need plastic, it is quite essential in our daily lives.

We can and should burn most of the household trash, to prevent it from landing in the seas, if we look after nature, it will handle the ""slight"" increase of burned trash. Not as it is now, but in the future we can if we act now.",0,73,2023-12-16 08:00:51,en,ClimateOffensive

18gboac,"White Christmas (Bing Crosby, 1941)","The song White Christmas was written in 1941for the movie Holiday Inn, situated in the fictional town of Pine Tree Vermont.

*I'm dreaming of a white Christmas, Just like the ones I used to know...*

[**White Christmas**](https://youtu.be/v5ryZdpEHqM?si=4pmpm__N30vRiMjs)

This made me wonder, are there fewer White Christmases now than in 1941?  The answer is - nobody knows.  To qualify as a white Christmas you only need one inch of snow on the ground on Christmas morning.  So it may depend on how long the snow lasts from the days before Christmas.  And you can't infer much from historical snowfall measurements.  Over the years the method for measuring snowfall changed several times, so you can't accurately compare snowfall from one decade to another. 

Bottom line - don't worry about a White Christmas as a climate issue.  Just enjoy the season and the song.

Meanwhile 20,000 [protesters in Belgium](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/there-is-no-planet-b-belgian-climate-protest-tells-cop28-2023-12-03/) (3200 miles away) marched to deliver a message to COP28.  I guess meaningful protesting is just too inconvenient.

In 1968 Vietnam War protesters ignored orders issued by the mayor of Chicago.  They were well organized, looking to send a message to the Democratic National Convention to end the war.  Authorities mobilized about 20,000 police, National Guard, Firemen, secret service... News anchor Walter Cronkite reported: ""The Democratic convention is about to begin in a police state. There just doesn't seem to be any other way to say it."".

There is much more to this story, including a trial of the organizers where a defendant was bound and gagged in a courtroom.  More details at this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Seven).  The event inspired this song:

The co-founder of XRJapan's book is now available for FREE download. Simon Whalley's book Dear Indy: A Father’s Plea for Climate Action is a clarion call to humanity to look inside itself and see the damage our species is inflicting on the natural world, the animals that share our incredible planet, and how this is leading, ultimately, to the sixth extinction, that will likely include us.

The book takes us on a journey around the world to see how the climate crisis is already impacting our planet and where we are heading on our current trajectory. From natural disasters barreling through cities and deluges destroying crops; heatwaves killing thousands, and wildfires killing billions of animals, the book looks at the risks we face from ignoring the threat of climate change and biodiversity loss. It also highlights the threat of both economic and societal collapse. The impacts humanity is having on the natural world are described and our treatment of non-human animals is detailed with links being made between the future of ecosystems and our own.

Dear Indy then goes back in time to the start of the inequality and the beginning of our thirst for greed. We then travel forward, stopping briefly to identify key events and salient individuals that have led us to the precipice we currently inhabit.

Finally, we look at solutions that our elites are pushing us towards in order to continue the march towards “progress”, and then look at alternative solutions that would benefit the masses, rather than the few, while simultaneously allowing us to remain within our carbon budget, and give the forests and oceans a chance to bounce back from the brink.

My points are: He lives with his three kids in a huge, gas heated, not isolated mansion with big old window fronts in Germany. He has an outside pool that he's heating in winter with electricity. He has a sauna in the basement. They're only drying their laundry with a tumble dryer. He changed three cars in five years, the last two are teslas though. He took a flight with his whole family to thailand this year and now he wants to make 10 friends fly for a weekend for his birthday to a place three hours flighttime away. I'm not judging him but at least he should keep it down telling everyone how dangerous climate change is. 

His points are: Teslas are more sustainable than fuel cars. He lives in a small town and needs a car with the kids *(there's busses and trains but that takes more time than with the car yes)*. he barely eats meat. he didn't shop clothes since a year. he has a contract for eco-electricity.

Have your say on [Australia's new nature positive laws](https://consult.dcceew.gov.au/australias-new-nature-positive-laws).

Key aspects of the failings of this legislation.

1. The Act only focuses on Domestic emissions and not the emissions from burning exported fossil fuels.
2. There is no climate trigger, only a safeguard mechanism activated by exceeding a limit on domestic emissions for a single project. A massive loophole you can drive a gas tanker through.
3. Self-assessment and reporting is the primary mechanism for the legal process to be activated.
4. No consideration of climate change impacts on biodiversity habitat shifts.
5. No retroactive enforcement on existing mining leases and their environmental rehabilitation.
6. Very limited definitions of ""unacceptable impacts"".
7. The minister for environment may override  (call in?) the ostensibly independent EPA assessments of any project in the National Interest. A mechanism that has failed the community in many other government bodies.

Aussie citizens. Please comment on this legislation. It may help but the fix may already be in if my experience in the first webinar on the matter is any experience.

I am a second year environmental science major, i have been deeply interested in climate change and our future for the past two years and have overall learned a lot.… my question is are we completely screwed? My mind can literally not wrap around the mass migration that we are going to witness, the famine, the DISEASE (zoonotic and vector diseases, diseases in the ice that is melting), and deep ocean heat distribution that might stop?? Our crops that will die. And what is even crazier is that, my country America, is responsible for half the carbon in the atmosphere, we are responsible for the mass migration of Africa at this moment, the unbearable heat in India and the Middle East, and the US is one of the safest places to be from climate change. I find myself incredibly sad and mad at politicians, at my country, and I’ve just been trying to just be in nature as much as I can for as long as I can. Ecosystems dying at the masses, f*ing Americans that say not in my backyard and can’t live with large carnivores because they want to f*ing surf or hunt, organisms everywhere are migrating north. Is there any hope, because from what I have learned and having a current sense of what is going on, I cannot see it happening especially at the rate we are going. I’m also having anxiety about the storms we are going to be having, at much greater intensities.

From what I had researched slowing down a ship just a bit can actually give massive positive changes,

Changing the shape of the propellors that reduce the bubbles,

Even putting on specific holes on the propellor that prevents the formation of bubbles,

ship hulls to design consistent wakes that reduce noise and make the ship faster,

Is there anything else that can decrease sound pollution?

As the title suggests, I’m now in university and vegan-curious. Just a question- as a starter, how much ‘veganism’ per sé is enough? I try to buy vegan whenever I can/see someting, but its good to know that big industries have also hijacked the vegan movement, as vegan alternatives are often £2/3 more expensive. My ultimate aim is to only have one (1) piece of meat, steak, per week on a Friday, and even then that may be phased out eventually, but for now, how much is enough for the threshold of environmental vegan-curiousness?

*It's nature's way of telling you, Something's wrong*

*It's nature's way of telling you, its in the breeze*

*It's nature's way of telling you, dying trees*

This song made me wonder, **when did we first start to pay attention to CO2 pollution and green house gases?**  **The answer is surprising**:

In the **1820s**, French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier theorized that our atmosphere acted like a green house to trap solar radiation and keep the planet warm. Later scientists proved by experiment that CO2 was likely the gas that helped to trap the heat.

In **1895** Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius determined the relationship between the density of CO2 in the atmosphere and the change in the earth's temperature.  Arrehenius wrote, “*By the influence of the increasing percentage of carbonic acid \[CO2\] in the atmosphere, we may hope to* ***enjoy*** *ages with more equable and better climates, especially as regards the colder regions of the earth*.”

**Well, maybe ""*****enjoy*****"" was not the right word.**

17qhru0,Is the charge off the climate cliff deliberate?,"Unfortunately, I think it has now got to the point where the only explanation for the inaction from those in power is that they know that catastrophic climate change is inevitable and impossible to stop and that they are deliberately driving collapse as the only way to save themselves.

Those in power will have extensively modelled the consequences of climate collapse and must know that global food systems are in imminent danger of collapse, that economies will likewise collapse and that billions of people will become migrants as a result, trying to move away from the sacrifice zones to (what they see as) more liveable parts of the globe. Once all that shit hits the fan, it is survival of the fittest.

So much right-wing policy and rhetoric from Western governments and media, as well as the widespread militarisation of police, seems geared precisely to 'manage' these scenarios. Have those in charge made the calculation that the only hope for humanity is a massive population decrease (hence letting Covid rip and allowing the collapse of the systems which feed the world)?

The billionaires (let's call them that - I mean the rich people with the global power who know what's coming and are 'super-prepping') want to be in charge of who survives. These elites would want to keep up the pretence that everything is fine as long as possible giving them longer to prep and accumulate even more power and wealth to 'ride the storm.' To do that, they need people to keep consuming, driving cars, staying distracted by shopping, celebs, sport, war etc as long as possible (remember, positive change doesn't matter under this scenario, it's too late for substantive change now anyway in this calculation).

These elites would figure on a period of terrible turmoil as populations finally realise it is too late and huge swathes of people understand that they are going to starve to death. If the elites can ride out that storm (with their bunkers and arsenals of weapons), they get to inherit the globe with a much smaller, more manageable population of 500 million or so.

That population could then be returned to a feudal system with the overlords (or their descendants) equipped with the kind of tech which will see them stabilise the living remnant of the planet (populations concentrated away from the equator), develop clean energy and promote nature's recovery as much as possible in a bid to create a society most people now would view as fascist, but those in charge would no doubt view as a utopia.

Maybe that's a dark vision, but I don't really see what other explanation there can be for the headlong charge off the climate cliff, other than it is a desperate last deliberate roll of the dice by those with the power and wealth to make the decision. Under this nightmare scenario, the quicker the collapse occurs, the better. The immediate benefit for these elites is that they get to live in relative luxury for the rest of their lives behind their defensive walls with their stockpiles of stash. The longer term benefit, if they care at all, is that they hope their descendants become the new ruling elites who inherit the earth and lionise their billionaire ancestors as the saviours of humanity through their sanitised history books.

That being said, I'm not stating the war isn't having an impact, but it wasn't as severe for North America as it's being blasted online. 

This really went against most of the narratives that I have been seeing, and when I looked further into what is disrupting our supply chains, most of that seemed to be the fault of climate change. It's barely mentioned on any platform and it is dismissed on others. Everyone is so quick to blame everything but the real issue. 

I know this is just a statement piece but I just wanted to share from the perspective of someone who doesn't understand a lot about climate change and economics. I feel like there are a lot more people like me, who will not get the opportunity to have to submit a 10-page essay.

As I’m sure it’s apparent, a world over 2C would spell more doom than what this year already has.

In this letter he engages the skeptics and deniers, he is critical of international coordination, and disapproving of Western consumerism.

The consistent core of his message is that ***when we care for our planet we care for each other***.  That includes caring for people we don't know, in other parts of the world, and in future generations.

That inspired me to use the ""way back time machine"" to find the song originally recorded by Jackie DeShannon, and made famous a year later by Dionne Warwick.

17b3gs6,Call for World Government as Solution for Climate Change,"I think that the best solution for climate change would be to call for a world government. More specifically, a world government that is a federal global government that has jurisdiction exclusively over world crises, climate change, military issues, citizenship (allowing for United Nations Citizenship, meaning the right to live and work anywhere in the world, and national citizenship, giving you the right to vote in national elections and run for office in national elections (if in democratic country), granted by having a residence in a residence in a country for two years and, if you have more than one residence in multiple countries, you will have both countries citizenship if you owned the residence for at least two years and can prove that you have paid taxes to each country \[people without a residence would have the national citizenship of their last residence\] pandemics, border disputes between countries, internet jurisdiction, international commerce, defined specifically as someone who crosses a national line and what they do while they travel to their final destination, and an object that is traveled across a national line under the same circumstances as a person, space jurisdiction (until other planets potentially create their own world governments), and scientific discoveries relating to weapons that can cause mass destruction. Everything else would be under the jurisdiction of the nations states and their respective regional states/provinces.

The reason I believe this is the solution to climate change is because I do not believe that countries like the US are willing to take enough action on climate change to truly fix the issue. If we have a federal world government, preferably under the UN, as it is an already existing global institution, it would be able to solve the climate problem, as it will be able to implement solutions all throughout the world.

For my call to action, I recommend that you write to your local countries's lawmakers and ask them to get a World Constitutional Convention started, specifically, next year at the UN Summit of the Future, as they are planning on strengthening global governance at that event. I have also created a petition that you can sign (although I posted that on another subreddit, so I will not post it, but it is on [change.org](https://change.org)).

According to the [Department of Energy](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/driveHabits.jsp) as speed increases, so does wind resistance, and fuel economy becomes worse.

Dropping the speed limit from 70 to 55 reduces fuel consumption by 17%, and only adds 5 minutes to a 20 mile trip.  [MPGforspeed.com](https://MPGforspeed.com) estimates this could **save 1 Billion barrels of oil per year,** a 13% reduction in total US oil consumption!

Reddit, Twitter, Tiktok. None are perfect, but all can work if you know how to use them.

Anyone too scared to attack under their own name, use Alt accounts, [VPNs](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwju3OeZp-aBAxUP4QIHHWNBCyQQFnoECAYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrowsec.com%2Fen%2F&usg=AOvVaw2w6cOHBroQmmwgNyJp5NdA&opi=89978449),  or put ""Allegedly"" before your attacks - ""Allegedly, ExxonMobil are responsible for the deaths of millions thanks to their disgusting lies and profiteering.""

Or frame attack as a question (Tucker Carlson style) - ""Do Shell want to profit from mass flooding, or do they just not care?""

I doubt any oil company would take any of us to court as it would give them negative publicity and that's what they are most scared of, but in case anyone is paranoid, use the above.

I created an Alt twitter account to [attack oil companies](https://twitter.com/FrankKane80/status/1708055662817652878) and anyone who helps them. I don't care how many people see, I will keep going. Every week more. If they respond, even better. More negative publicity for them.

A short, relevant message from George Orwell:

""We believe half-instinctively that evil always defeats itself in the long run. We have become too civilized to grasp the obvious...to survive you often have to fight, and to fight you have to dirty yourself. War is evil, and it is often the lesser evil."" - Orwell.

It's time to dirty ourselves r/climateoffensive. There is no cause more worthy. Every attack that is seen by at least one person spreads the message a bit further. If we all use the same attack line, even 1000 of the 60,000+ of us in this sub, the algorithms will pick it up, amplifying it further.

173og66,"Individual scale option for climate action ""CO2 receipts""","I have an idea for something a climate conscious individual can do that will hopefully make at least a little difference.

The idea is to print ""CO2 receipts"" that mimic shopping receipts but instead of recording cost, records carbon footprint. Specifically, I plan on hanging around near various gas stations, and when someone fills up their car's tank and leaves to pay, I calculate (roughly) how much CO2 would be produced by the amount of gas they bought, print a CO2 receipt and place it on the car's windshield. I'm still workshopping what the receipt will say but something along the lines of:

Thank you for your purchase of

**XX.X tonnes of CO2**

*\[Time and date\]*

We hope its worth it.

Maybe consider catching the bus next time.

\[website or social media link\]

Now obviously this isn't comparable to organised protests, lobbying, radical action or divestment, but maybe it'll get some news coverage and/or start a bit of a movement.

At the end of the day, it will at least get some people thinking about climate change and hopefully reduce transport emissions a little.

1734lv0,Priorities if we hope to win on climate,"The biggest (and vitally, the fastest) wins are in methane and refrigerants… from four major sources accounting for a little less than 40% of our emissions' global warming potential during the vital, do-or-die near term:

- Replace the current generation of HFC refrigerants which have 12,900x the greenhouse effect of CO2, with either the natural refrigerant ammonia like is now happening in Europe, or HFOs, which though 185x the GHG clout of CO2 is still a vast improvement over HFCs.  

Refrigerants solves a little less than 10% of our GHG problem, but refrigerant use is expected to grow as formerly temperate regions shift to buying air conditioners.

Another 30% of our GHG problem comes from methane:

- Go all-in on stopping methane leaks from oil and gas infrastructure.  EVERY natural gas well, storage, pipeline or end-use equipment in the world leaks, including your Weber or kitchen stove or space heating or hot water heating.  But on this one, the Big Kahunas are the world’s often filthy oilfields, starting at home with the Permian in west Texas.  

- Go all-in on the vast power of methane leaks from the world’s landfills with improved covers plus diversion of green waste and, vitally, food waste to more beneficial uses.  Conveniently, unlike in oil and gas, there are mere hundreds of landfills in most nations, not tens of thousands like in the fossil fuel industry, so perhaps that lends focus to activism... fewer, bigger targets: Super Emitter Landfills.

- Go all-in on methane emissions from dairy and beef cattle manure, and their burps.  This is harder than it sounds, because of high customer demand.  But in my state of California, an oil state, cows literally cause 55% of methane emissions.

Methane has 84x the GHG power of CO2 over the vital short term, but is one of only a few quick wins available to humanity to prevent a tipping right dang now, because it’s half life in the atmosphere is only 8 years versus CO2’s 53 years!!!

171gsyy,A potentially helpful perspective on fighting climate change,"So I'm dreadful at not overthinking, which is why a year ago I was very much in a near catatonic state of depression and apathy when it came to issues like climate change. It's for this exact reason, and the suspicion I have that there are more out there like me, that I'd like to share my perspective on ways to fight the problem. 

Focus on the economic side. I know it sounds insane at a first glance, but think about it.
If doing things that helped the global climate and biodiversity were more profitable than not, what would stop people from doing those things? Even climate change deniers? 

If, say, electric cars were more efficient, affordable, and convenient than gas powered, the average consumer wouldn't buy them because they don't produce trace carbon emissions- they'd buy them because it would be the best decision economically! Similarly, if we focus on getting energy production and storage to the point where the clean was undeniably more profitable than the dirty, fossil fuel companies would have to either jump ship or sink. 

So that's my idea and message. If you want to focus on getting corporations and governments to take accountability for the damage they're doing, that's fine, but I don't believe it will do as much good as we need done. I say we should focus on near non-stop innovation of renewable energies and storage, as well as getting the science more precise and doing what we can to protect biodiversity in our planet's ecosystems. Improve batteries, improve solar cell efficiency, improve education on the importance of these issues, whether you're a teacher or a parent or just a person with a device on the Internet trying to find ways to make a difference. It's a really, really steep road ahead, but I think with a little ingenuity we can definitely make a difference. 

Don't lose hope because governments are corrupt and corporations are powerful. That isn't going to change. But the wheels they run on can be changed. I hope anyone reading this understands what I'm getting at. If you do and appreciate the message, do all you can to spread it to others, in my words or your own. We can absolutely fight this. We just need to shift our perspective a little, roll up our sleeves and get our hands dirty.",22,21,2023-10-06 12:27:00,en,ClimateOffensive

170gcyf,What's hindering us,"I was born in California and now live in New England in the United States for around ten years now and I've noticed that people can be as cold as the winters here. Why? 

I've been thinking incessantly about it. Our social systems are fractured. There doesn't seem to be any real sense of community only tiny little morsels left for us to make us feel like we are yet it's not actually sufficient and we are left wanting more; NEEDING more. 

Maybe I'm just stating things we all know but I've found that the 9-5 grind depletes us more than we think. I find that I have so much energy in the middle of the day to fight or do something but I can't do anything about it because I'm in the middle of my shift. All I can do is write notes When it comes to actually do something about it, I'm drained. And now I have endless notes to sift through yet no action had been taken. yet. 

Not to mention that this 9-5 grind, makes having a social life difficult, it seems like every interaction I have is transactional. All business, no genuine human connection. Everyone's rushing to get from point A to point B because we've been trained to since we started school. It doesn't help that we all live so far away from each other due to zoning ordinances and a car centric society. 

This in itself, corrodes our well-being. It corrodes our families, our friends, ourselves and ultimately our planet. 

My coworker wasn't doing well these past few weeks because he was going through a lot of turmoil, I wanted to reach out to him but I couldn't because we had to go out and make some money after the boss told us to get going. Not only that but he had the worst sales week in a long time. No shit! Why do we allow this to continue? When one person is down it can affect the rest of the team. Separate home from work? Bullshit! It still affects performance whether you shine a light on it or not. 

Same thing is happening with movements, we're at alarming levels of mental health issues caused by ISOLATION which is caused by our economy and it's by design.

Not enough is getting done because we still go along with this shit. We still isolate ourselves because we're drained by our jobs that take advantage of us.

16zchec,Suggestions of closed loop systems to combat endless consumption?,"As we know, capitalism thrives on consumable goods and one-time-use products. What are some ways we as a society and individuals can knock out certain industries that continue to pollute by closing loops? 

e.g. Instating a law that prohibits the refining and burning of petroleum with the exception of existing recycled/disposed petroleum-based products. 

No longer will we be removing additional oil from the earth to power production and distribution of consumable goods. This would eventually halt the production of these goods in general because the available petroleum will be consumed during the production process. It would force the hand of corporations to find sustainable alternative solutions and use their available wealth and resources to power that research. No longer fueling their infinite growth with the added benefit of eliminating plastic pollution and waste (think about how hard they would try to extract micro-plastics from the oceans if it was their only way to mine additional petroleum!)

I’m 19, due to turn 20 next year, but with all of… everything happening to the world, I’m honestly not confident I’ll even make it to 50. I have autism and ADHD, plus I was born when the internet was blooming, so those combined make me dwell on negative events far more than positive ones, even more so with what’s happening to the climate around me.

I had a mental breakdown at work last month due to the heat wave, and that really was what led me to be scared for my future. I want to get into college and own my own home. I know there’s plenty of things I can do to cut back on my own emissions, but even doing that wouldn’t help one bit at all. I already use Ecosia but I’m fearing that alone isn’t enough. Doom and gloom have just perpetuated no matter what around my head, and with the possibility of exceeding 2C that’s not at all making it better. I want to hold on to some kind of hope for a better world, but every news article saying the opposite, that ecosystems are collapsing is shooting down all that, and I fear I’m playing right into the oil companies’ hands.

So, I’ve been climate conscious since I was around 13/14. Been terrified of it and haven’t talked about it ever since, driving myself insane in the process, several times. I’ve done many things since I learned about it, going for more vegan options/turning off at outlets etc, but the one thing i haven’t done is go out and protest. A lot of people, mainly activists, say that protest is the most effective form of direct climate action, but ive never been to any protest of any cause. I dont know what it is about them that gets me, but they just get my heart racing, fear-wise. Trouble is, now I just don’t feel like I deserve to be accepted as someone who isnt complicit in the awful things to come. I follow a lot of activists from many different groups online (mainly from JSO) who only really post things about how not doing a certain action is complicitness, normally protest. If they dont say it, to me they imply it at least. I try to convince myself that theyre meant for those who are just sitting bakc and doing nothing, but my brain still tells me that theyre meant for me too.

Yes we’re back. Until we make this happen I will not stop. Nothing is more important than our world and our future. It's time to [attack](https://twitter.com/FrankKane80/status/1700885098738937995?s=20).

First, I want to **thank you all**. I made the original post because I could not understand how oil companies were not being blamed and attacked more. Based on the amount of support, I guess I’m not alone in feeling that way. If you already know the drill, skip the next 3 paragraphs.

If you haven’t read the previous posts, basically fossil fuel companies have known they were causing climate change for decades. [They lied about it](https://www.ciel.org/news/oil-tobacco-denial-playbook/) on an industrial scale and are still trying to stop the energy transition because **they want to keep selling fuel that heats the planet.** Apparently childrens' futures don’t matter to oil companies. They continue to spread lies and try to reframe the narrative, paying everyone from tiktokers, thinktanks and lobbyists to do so.

Oil companies are paying people to speak in their defence because they are guilty, and they know what the public believes matters. They know when public opinion turns, they are going to have Big Problems. That shift in opinion is already happening. Let’s accelerate it. The more people who know what oil companies have done, the greater public anger against them will be, and the harder it will be for them to defend themselves. The more toxic their image, the harder making business deals, new pipelines and influencing government policy will become for the Oil Companies.

We coordinate attack lines that we post and share online in an attempt to go viral. Facts are important, but we need to change people's minds too. Humour and outrage are the most effective tools for engagement, so we harness them in our attacks.

Last post we put forward attack ideas. The ideas that got the most upvotes were:

1. Find the top 100 CO2 producing companies. Ask each one of them publicly how much money it would take to get them to stop emitting CO2, under the pretext to get financing for the lowest offer with the highest impact. What we really achieve with this is to manifest the idea in peoples heads that those companies hold our future and wellbeing hostage, that we would have to buy us free, whilst giving them a list of specific enemies to project their anger at - credit to u/[Pherdl](https://www.reddit.com/user/Pherdl/)
2. Oil corporations take our tax money without our consent. Time for them to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. Stop subsidies for these welfare billionaires. - credit - u/[NikiLauda88](https://www.reddit.com/user/NikiLauda88/)

Both ideas are excellent. With idea 2, we just need to take the message and spread it. Copy it exactly or make your own variation. Back it up by linking to  this [article](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/fossil-fuel-subsidies-2022) showing fossil fuel subsidies reached an all time high of 7 trillion last year, which is madness.

With Idea 1, I think we need to focus on max 3 of the top polluting companies. I suggest Shell, BP and Exxon. I already posted it above, but here's the idea in action in an [attack against Shell](https://twitter.com/FrankKane80/status/1700885098738937995?s=20).

Anyone who posts on twitter put a link in this thread and I will like, reshare and folllow. I encourage you all to do the same. Anyone worried about revealing your identity just make an alt account.

16balpl,"A Simple, Collective Act to Realign Humanity's Pulse and Heal Our Planet","We talk a lot about the actions we can take to combat climate change—reducing emissions, conserving resources, advocating for policy changes. These are crucial, no doubt, but sometimes the enormity of it all can feel overwhelming. What if we introduced something simpler, something universal?

Imagine taking a single deep breath, but not alone—in concert with another person, a group, a community, or even the entire planet. How powerful would it be to share this basic human act as a synchronized effort, across continents, religions, and cultures?

I propose that we set aside moments in our day to take a collective, intentional deep breath. Let's call it ""Breathing for Humanity."" By doing this, we do more than pause; we create a global cadence, a heartbeat that sends a message of unity and purpose. And perhaps, just perhaps, this collective act could serve to steady humanity's ""nervous system,"" offering a shared respite from the frenzied pace that often leads to reckless decisions affecting our climate.

We're all here because we care deeply about the Earth. And Earth, fundamentally, is what allows us to breathe. So why not give a moment back? A moment of gratitude, of unity, and of shared purpose?

The logistics are simple. We collectively decide on a specific time (or times) of the day and then, wherever we are, we take a slow, deep breath. And if you're outdoors or in a public space, take a moment to acknowledge others you see participating.

What do you think?

But I recently found out that Lee Raymond is the man that maybe has the single largest role in causing climate change. He covered up Exxon’s research, killed their alternative energy efforts, and started denying the role that fossil fuels had on warming the planet.

Guess what? He’s still alive!! He’s 83, he’s exceedingly wealthy, and exceedingly comfortable.

I want to make him trend. Everyone should know his name. Personally, I think he should be put on a Nuremberg-style trial for his crimes in the name of greed. But that’s a long-term plan and there’s not a ton of long term for an 83 year old. The first thing we need to do is make sure everyone knows that he exists. He should be uncomfortable with his station in life.

167n7w5,Participate in the Republican Presidential Primary,"I just switched to the Republican party so I can vote in the upcoming primary for president. You may not have to switch parties, it depends on your specific state election laws. 

I know there is not a stand-out candidate on climate in the Republican field but how the debate is framed is still important. The less worse candidates on climate generally line up with those who are pro-democracy which is helpful. I know for many this may be hard to vote for any Republican but with no Democratic presidential primary, this is one of the easiest ways to make our voice heard before November. Political parties do shift and we can be part of that.

None of these candidates have the answers I’d prefer, but they are much better than some other candidates who call climate change a hoax (Trump, Ramaswamy)  or have their state reject climate money (DeSantis). 

* Chris Christie - [Yes, it’s real. Attacks what Biden did.](https://youtu.be/ADnz0leTrP0?t=19)
* Nikki Haley - [Yes, it’s real. Attacks what Biden did. Blames India/China](https://youtu.be/RWkJX8iA6ms?t=54)
* Asa Hutchinson - I can’t find a clip but I understand he was raising his hand to say it was real.

We can shift the Republican debate from ""Is climate change real?"" to ""How will you fight climate change?""

Take action:

1. Figure out your states rules/times, [start here](https://ballotpedia.org/Primary_election_systems_by_state) (Note some states like California treat the presidential race differently than other races). 
2. Switch your party ASAP if needed (might be time limit to switch to vote).
3. Vote in the primary when the times comes.

164hcjo,Easy switch to renewable energy,"Yesterday I went to my electric utility company's web site for the first time in years to check on Energy Star Rebates for an appliance.  I was already aware of ""Supplier Choice"" and ""Time-of-Use Pricing"", so I checked my options.   Under Supplier Choice I was able to find a supplier with 100% renewable power for less than the cost of my traditional plan.  15 month fixed price plan for about 8 cents per kW h.  The reason is that my standard rates went up significantly last year (duh.. see chart).

I'm also looking into the Time-of-Use-Pricing option.  I have an EV, and I can save about 50% by charging my car over night.  Costs are higher during the day, so I'm currently analyzing my usage to see if this will work out; it looks good so far.

OK, I'm sure many of you have already done this, but as someone living in rural Pennsylvania, it came as a surprise that this was an option.

**ACTION: Check with you power company for renewable energy options and switch if competitive.  Tell your neighbor's and friends.**

If you take this action, can you reply and let us all know how it worked out?  It may help to encourage others in our group.  For reference my electric utility is West Penn Power in Pennsylvania.

**The reason:** Fossil fuel corporations have attacked our home. Fossil fuel corporations are boiling the Earth for money.[They're adding degrees celsius onto the temperature of our planet as if it was just the cost of business](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/global-temperatures). They have committed fraud on an industrial scale to cover it up. And the temperature keeps rising. For decades, these companies have been ruining our future. Playing God. Holding back change. Until now. [They are being taken to court for their climate crimes](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiS_NXAgv2AAxUUU6QEHacbDxAQFnoECBAQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2023%2Fjun%2F07%2Fclimate-crisis-big-oil-lawsuits-constitution&usg=AOvVaw0xkLAdX1xOdL3J9e4T1xxb&opi=89978449). They are losing. The digital revolution still hasn’t finished, but the [green revolution has already begun](https://www.iea.org/news/rapid-progress-of-key-clean-energy-technologies-shows-the-new-energy-economy-is-emerging-faster-than-many-think).

Right now, our biggest obstacle is our collective inaction.

Fossil fuel corporations have paid marketers millions to convince us to remain inactive. Instead of admitting their mistake and reinvesting sustainably, they continued ruining our planet like the toxic ex that just won’t leave.

There have been decades of manipulation and lies from them - climate denial, telling us it was our responsibility, then pushing the idea that it was too late to save ourselves, all to promote inactivity. They are afraid of us taking action. They do not underestimate the backlash they will face.

**The plan:** It’s time to give them that backlash. Below we choose our lines of attack for this week.

The rules are simple. Post comments separately to ideas. **Put attack ideas in \[square brackets\]**. If you want to explain why you think the \[attack idea\] will work, put the explanation in the same comment outside of the \[brackets\].

**Upvote the ideas that are most likely to go viral**. I’ll put in a few ideas at the start to get the ball rolling.

We post the most upvoted attack ideas on different platforms. The ideas don’t have to be reposted in the same words. Build off of them. The key is to have a lot of people post variations on the same message. If enough people repeat the idea, it sticks. That’s our weapon against fossil fuel companies. Mass repetition.

Wanna save the planet? Sustain an online attack on fossil fuels. It needs to [last 6-8 weeks to have a long term effect on public opinion](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/re6FsKPgbFgZ5QeJj/effective-strategies-for-changing-public-opinion-a). Every Sunday we decide which ideas to attack with that week. During the week, post variations of the attack ideas on different platforms. Like and share other people who are doing the same. **Humour and** [outrage](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/21/anger-is-most-powerful-emotion-by-far-for-spurring-climate-action-study-finds) **tend to be the most effective.**

This is how we change the world, and how we do something about the climate crisis. Accelerate the end of fossil fuels. For the good of the planet and our collective future.

Yes, also vote, educate and support other long term solutions. But right now the world needs urgent action. If you want to take some, post your \[attack ideas\] below and upvote the best attack ideas.",237,26,2023-08-27 10:30:47,en,ClimateOffensive

Hey,

I’m Maddie, a university student from the UK, and one of the youth committee from #0beef.

Want to join us in taking urgent action to combat climate change ? We’re reaching out to find a few select students to join our campaign and make a real difference within their Universities.

Did you know that your canteen could cut its emissions by 40% per year with just a few simple
menu changes in their menu? - that’s the carbon equivalent of 136 024 economy class return air
journeys between London and New York every year.

Thanks to the experience we have working with institutions like the University of Cambridge,
and schools like North London Collegiate School and Eltham Hill School in Greenwich, we can
help to guide your canteen and service staff in the transition.- but we need your help to get the
movement started.

We’d love to be able to help to make it easy for you to make a major positive impact on your
university's carbon footprint. Check out our website to find out more.(0beef.com).

If you’d like to lend a hand to grow this campaign, drop me a message either on here, or on Instagram (@0beef) so we can set up a call :)

If the oil companies want to play dirty, let's do the same right back. Elections are won by making people hate the other guy and too many attacks on Big Oil rely on factual arguments that don't show them for the villains they are. Unfortunately, facts alone don't move the dial of public opinion. We have the science, they have their increasingly desperate publicity campaigns. They think we can't coordinate against them, I say we can.

Let's see how much damage we can do to the fossil fuel industry's image. I'm talking full on, coordinated online campaign, across as many social media platforms as possible. Decide a few key talking points and hashtags right here in this thread - then unleash them at peak usage time, preferably after big climate news stories come out that we can build off.

We need to find the most destuctive talking points. I mean using not just facts but feelings.  They have to lie, we don't. Use humour, incite fear, outrage, disgust - in other words make it as likely as possible to go viral.

15xgmea,Tracking our individual impacts on the world through ESG ratings,"&#x200B;

[Mock-up of ESG scores ](https://preview.redd.it/btc0a5nqmhjb1.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=13920d7c88791b2579b6167e5fe135a136731ef7)

&#x200B;

We've had ESG ratings for decades now, but it hasn't  played a significant role in the eyes of the consumer. Sure it has developed new investing policies and has made some impact from the shareholder side, but as someone who's worked in environmental consulting, I felt that we needed a more direct way of getting ESG ratings into the mass conscience.

**Do you think individuals should be aware of our own ESG rating?**

I feel that companies would take ESG ratings  seriously if consumers changed their purchase behaviors based on the score.

The current method of consumer activism has yielded lackluster results. This is because once the news dies down, consumers forget about the scandal and go back to normal purchasing behavior. In addition, companies aren't really incentivized to make changes, since consumers hear about the scandal, but rarely stay informed about what was done about it.

The first step towards voting with our dollars is to be aware of our current ESG impact. This can be approximated through the ESG score of the companies you are purchasing goods/services from, multiplied by the dollar amount of your purchase. [Sustainalytics](https://www.sustainalytics.com/) has a comprehensive ESG rating for most public companies. For purchases from businesses that are private (and doesn't have any ESG rating), we can approximate from comparable public companies, or use other indicators (BCorp, Fair Trade, etc.)

Please let me know what you think!

Individual ESG scores could elevate sustainable conscience to another level, which would lead to climate activism on a larger scale.",0,0,2023-08-21 14:59:12,en,ClimateOffensive

If the ask is truly as clever as i think (relatively easy to implement and to track outcomes, can be initiated on local scale and scale up, creates small yet tangible adaptation effect, and would generate millions of conversations if actually implemented) then it would be great for it to spread.

Two weeks ago, I posted here about an oil company trying to to build a 16- pump gas station and car wash over a water cave that leads to Wakulla springs, which is the world's deepest freshwater spring. 

You all were super-helpful with your suggestions and donations, and my friend's non-profit- [Downriver Project: Clean Water Wakulla](https://www.facebook.com/CleanWaterWakulla), along with other environmental groups in the county were able to involve the [Department of Environmental Protection](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/opinion/2023/08/06/former-dep-secretary-a-gas-station-near-wakulla-springs-has-never-been-a-good-idea/70525975007/), the statewide media and the people of the county.

Despite the excessive heat warning in the area, over 400 people from across the county attended the county meeting and provided comments to the commissioners. They were able to delay and possibly derail plans by the Southwest Georgia Oil Company. 

The county commissioners announced that the State of Florida will possibly purchase the land through the Florida Forever fund to protect it. This is a good step in the right direction. However, the fight may continue and donations are still appreciated: [Downriver Project](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=67K22BFWHDPJE)

It seems like millions of people are organizing and coming together to act on climate, which is giving me hope (for the first time in a very long time). 

However, I do think **there must be better ways how we can organize financially** and come together as a voice for climate, not just a voice that vocalizes our dissent with the status quo. It's clear that our governments and big corporations are not acting fast enough for us to stay on track to our Net Zero goals and to avoid a complete ecological disaster.

**I'm trying to get an important conversation going here**: 

Do you have any thoughts / business ideas for how to create a product mechanism that will allow all of us to contribute a small amount financially to climate? 

I'm thinking, it would be a small sacrifice on an individual level, but together we could harness $$ billions to real climate causes overlooked by investors / governments, those that need it the most! 

For instance, the team behind [Australian Seaweed Institute](https://www.australianseaweedinstitute.com.au/) has developed a novel, cutting edge technology to protect the Great Barrier Reef from more climate damage, but they are having difficulty attracting much-needed funds from the government & commercial climate investors to carry out the 5-10 technology deployment program.

From the article:

When a criminal walks into a store and shoots the clerk behind the counter, we make the moral judgment that this behavior is socially unacceptable, and that the gunman should be punished. 

When a public official misuses and steals taxpayer money, we make the moral judgment that the embezzler should lose his job and, perhaps, be incarcerated.

Yet, when fossil fuel executives make calculated decisions that threaten millions of lives — and the planet itself — we are told that “it’s just business.”

That’s not acceptable.

That is why, earlier this week, I [sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-markey-merkley-and-warren-send-letter-to-attorney-general-urging-doj-to-bring-lawsuits-against-the-fossil-fuel-industry/) urging him to bring lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry in relation to its longstanding and carefully coordinated campaign to mislead consumers and discredit climate science in pursuit of massive profits. The letter was co-signed by Sens. Jeff Merkley, Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey.  


EDIT: As a non American I'm not sure of the avenues one would go through to petition the DOJ but everyone that can must get behind this. I really cant see how the world will be able to move forward without holding these people accountable.

I am completely aware the next 100 years on earth are going to be dangerous AF. Food instability, floods, droughts, fires, heat waves, sea levels, climate refugees, resource wars… I know this is bearing down on us NOW. 
The lovely folks over in the pregnant subreddit, for the most part, think climate change will not be impacting their children. I shouldn’t be surprised - most of them have planned a pregnancy, after all. The people who understand and accept the harsh reality of climate change are, I assume, at least a little less likely to be planning families.
One “history major” user proclaimed “this is the safest time in history to have a baby.” My jaw dropped. Scientists are predicting the jet stream could collapse as soon as 2025. Man, agriculture everywhere in the world could collapse! I tried to explain to everyone that this was simply not true. The upvoting for “climate change is real but it won’t effect MY child” was very clear in demonstrating their ignorance. 
How on earth is this possible? What do you even say to someone who has possibly willfully thrown out the facts for their convenience? “It’s real, it just will never effect me.” Yes, it will! That’s where the whole “it’s real” bit comes into play!
I struggled to choose which facts to start firing off: sea levels? Extreme weather? Mass migration of millions of desperate people? Food instability? I posted an article about two six year olds who died in Nova Scotia’s flash floods - two kids dead right now from extreme weather caused by climate change. They were unmoved.

15cyr19,Have a couple of questions,"Hi, everyone!  I 'm having a hard time finding my exact question answered when searching.  If we shade or otherwise prevent an area of the earth from absorbing heat from the sun, is that heat absorbed on earth somewhere else or some other way?  Or just reflected back into space?  

I'm working on shading a significant portion of my yard.  There are already tree's, but for instant shade in the area where I'm waiting for trees to grow, I'm going to use a combination of pergola and shade sails.  This very clearly keeps the area shaded from getting hot.  I know this and I've measured it.  The difference is significant.  40 to 60 degrees F significant.  

This got me thinking about heat islands and the like.  My assumption is that the areas that are shaded/blocked the heat is reflected back out with some absorbed by the atmosphere.  But, overall, does make the planet cooler.  (yep, I know, small scale, but could be scaled up).  Am I correct, or is there something I'm not considering.  

Where I'm going with this is obviously add shade.  We can even convince some of the climate deniers to add shade because it's hot in their yard in the summer.  I know, scale, and blah, blah.  It's A step.  But right now I'm focused on the mechanical aspect of does shade cool the planet, or just move the heat somewhere else? ",15,10,2023-07-29 14:07:53,en,ClimateOffensive

15biquv,"The world's deepest freshwater spring is under attack by an oil company, any ideas on how people can fight back?","Wakulla springs in Florida is the largest and deepest freshwater spring in the world. Right now, there is a concerning proposal by Southwest Georgia oil company to build a 16- pump gas station and car wash over a nearby water cave that leads to the springs that will contaminate this pristine ecosystem for centuries to come. My best friend grew up here and now runs a non-profit to protect the springs from evil corporations and oil companies.

The residents of Wakulla county have been fighting very hard to advocate for clean water and oppose the building of this gas station, they drafted a ""Citizens' Water Proposal,"" to protect their groundwater caves and springs from toxic petroleum contamination. They brought up this proposal at the County Commission meeting in hopes that the commissioners would  side with them and oppose the building of gas stations on their waters. However, the commissioners refused to even look at the proposal. This was a slap in the face to the 120+ people who attended, many of whom left work early to speak to their elected representatives.

Despite the setback, the residents of Wakulla County remain resolute in their fight. The Southwest Georgia Oil company will visit the springs in 2 weeks, to get the proposal for building the gas stations accepted because apparently the commissioners have been bribed and will not do anything to stop the destruction of the springs.

What can the residents do in the next two weeks to stop this catastrophe from happening? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: You can also donate to the non profit here: [Downwater Project](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=67K22BFWHDPJE). This will help them big time to fight the big oil company.

Most people who talk about it are either so doom-mongery that it has a damaging effect on my mental health, or so optimistic that they completely misrepresent the seriousness of the problem. One of the very small number of people who has come through my net is Dr Adam Levy, a climate scientist with a doctorate in atmospheric physics. He runs a wonderful YouTube channel, ClimateAdam, intending to discuss climate scenarios in a way that is both realistic accessible and doesn't overwhelm the viewer.

He's far and away the best person I've come across who talks about climate change. He doesn't play down the seriousness of the problem at all, but he's also very good at keeping things in perspective and not being hyperbolic about anything. He makes me feel capable of doing something to deal with the problem.

I hope you’re all doing well! I am the owner of a 20-acre plot of land in Accra, Ghana, and I am interested in exploring the potential of selling carbon credits to companies willing to buy them. However, I’m relatively new to this field and could use some guidance on how to proceed.  

Specifically, I’m looking for advice on two main aspects:  	
1.	Funding: I’m not necessarily in dire need of funding to kickstart this venture however I would like to explore those options. Are there any grants, funding programs, or investors I should look into to support my project? 	
2.	Selling Carbon Credits: I’d like to understand the process of selling carbon credits to interested companies. What are the steps involved, from verification to actual trading for credits from Africa? Are there any platforms or organizations I should connect with?  

I have cold called so many companies in the United States as I am based here but they all seem to only buy from US carbon sellers.

Any insights, tips, or resources you can share would be greatly appreciated! I believe that by tapping into carbon credits, we can contribute positively to the environment while also making a difference economically.  

Thank you all in advance for your support and knowledge!

If you had any kind of good day, you’re completely ignoring the problem. Ta da! You’re complicit. So, what did you do then? Oh, you’re visiting youre family in italy? Your family drove here? (Im M17) wow, even then, how ignorant can you be? Every car journey is bringing collapse even closer, and it’s youre fault for not calling it out. So what do you normally do when you’re back in your own country? Hm? Trainspotting? Birthday? Fun? How dare you, how absolutely dare you. Trains still emmit carbon, youre whitnessing and complicitly overseeing the death of many just so you can get your stupid little train fix. So your birthday is soon, you’re 18? Well don’t bother celebrating, there’s no point. You’ve no future and it’s selfish to even think you do. Remember, hope is complicity, hope is selfishness, if you accept you’ll die horribly and become miserable you’ll finally be accepted as a climate aware person. Any kind of positive emotion right now is just a sign of your disgusting complicity. Doom is coming, and you have to commit yourself to it right now, or why bother even trying… to live. If you don’t, you’re just as complicit and oblivious as the corporations, as the deniers, as the lawmakers. So, what are you gonna do tomorrow, eh? Complicitly let your dad drive you somewhere while you say nothing? Play games on your laptop that draws deadly power? Continue complicitly enjoying your silly little vacation? No amounts of family comfort, of them saying “we’re in this together”, will make you any more favourable. You should have converted them to a completely net zero family by now. Oh, you’re trying? Well try harder. So, what about your more immediate future, eh? Whats that? You want to go to university in September? Youve just crossed a massive line, an education? Really? How about you educate yourself on how complicit you’re being, going to a uni, shame on you. Ignore what people say, you’re not ‘being hard on yourself’, this is the truth.

159o2pj,"For those of you out there beginning to panic (me too), I present an action plan.","Edit: **This strategy doesn't replace other actions- far from it. Even if we stop all emissions tomorrow there is far too much energy already in the system.** It might push us over tipping points before we can reach net zero.

&#x200B;

Below I make the case that our top level problem, above all else, is that **the global weather and climatic systems are too overloaded with energy currently**. Even if emissions stop tomorrow **we desperately need to store the carbon already up there.**

Which leads us to...

**‘Nature based solutions’** as our only real hope to buy enough time to reach net zero/negative.

**Rewilding, reforesting, habitat restoration and expansion both on land and at sea at unprecedented scale**. We need to dump as much carbon and other infrared active gases into the earth as possible in the next 5/7-12 years. We **just** **might avoid the most serious impacts being locked in before we sort out emissions.**

If you don't read anything else in this post please read that. Our global systems have to much energy there already, even if we stop oil tomorrow this problem can still push us over the limit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

​A few doomers not reading the post and giving pushback keep missing that point. It's a hail Mary attempt to buy us a little extra time and keep an extra few hundred millions from climate poverty while we work on all the other strategies. Please no more posts about stopping oil- everybody on this sub agrees with that and it just shows you didn't fully read the post! Even if we stop oil tomorrow we still have a MASSIVE short/medium term problem. *This is a separate and under-discussed aspect that I wanted this sub's perspective on.*

I see a lot of posts here wondering what people can do to help avert climate breakdown in enough time. The comments are always filled with amazing suggestions from committed activists and I applaud you all.

This is a post about overall strategy to maximize impact. What are our top-level problems? **What specific actions can buy us enough time to achieve net-zero/negative before we cross too many tipping points?**

&#x200B;

Every action taken by every individual here is key. Some people have existing skill sets and experiences they can deploy in the fight. For those that don’t yet, I present the option guaranteed to maximize your impact.

If people like this might I suggest the mods take some of this content and create an action resource or pin this post for a while?

(I elaborate further below with resources and links at the very bottom but you get the drift)

(Edited to make a few unclear points more clear, I have provided more detailed justification for why this should be overarching strategy below)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**What is the top level target problem?**

**Problem 1**\- Global weather and climatic systems are too overloaded with energy currently.Too much heat retention for the planet.

**Problem 2-** It is hard to identify when we will cross each of the hundreds of tipping points.

**Problem 3**\- The web of life under us is rapidly unraveling.

Initial solutions:

**Problem 1:**

* ?????????????????????????????????

**Problem 2:**

* Reaching net zero/ environmental sustainability as far ahead of international targets as possible.
* Keeping fossil fuels in the ground.

**Problem 3:**

* Halting deforestation and biodiversity loss
* Habitat restoration

Problem 1 presents the greatest direct benefit but also is by far the most complicated to address.

&#x200B;

**Problem 1-  Global weather and climatic systems are too overloaded with energy currently.**

It is hard to identify when we will cross each of the hundreds of tipping points.Accumulation of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.

Rapid geoengineering and climate cooling techniques- EXTREMELY RISKY- will we have any choice however? What choices will we be forced to make and can we get ahead of them?

Give the race to net zero some breathing space.

Will the floor of biodiversity fall out from beneath us?

Net negative global emissions as soon as possible.

However, as the oceans continue to warm, they will take up less heat from the atmosphere and global average surface temperatures will rise further.

At the same time, the land and ocean are absorbing about half of the CO2 that humans emit each year. If emissions go to zero, these “carbon sinks” continue to take up some of the extra CO2 that was emitted in the past – quickly at first and then more slowly over time as they move toward a new equilibrium. This reduces the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere and, thus, the warming it causes.

By chance, these two factors cancel each other out.””

“Human emissions of aerosols – tiny particles of sulfur or nitrogen suspended in the atmosphere that reflect incoming sunlight back to space – have a strong cooling effect on the planet, though there are large uncertainties as to exactly how large this effect is. Aerosols also have a relatively short atmospheric lifetime and, if emissions cease, the aerosols currently in the atmosphere will quickly fall back out.

As a result, the world would be around 0.4C warmer if CO2 and aerosol emissions go to zero, compared to zero CO2 emissions alone.”

Other GHGs are also important drivers of global warming. Human-caused emissions of methane, in particular, account for about a quarter of the historical warming that the world has experienced.

Unlike CO2, methane has a short atmospheric lifetime, such that emissions released today will mostly disappear from the atmosphere after 12 years. This is the main reason why the world would cool notably by 2100 if all GHG emissions fell to zero. This would result in around 0.5C of cooling compared to a scenario where only CO2 falls to zero.

***Appendix: Nature of the problem.***

The triple Climate, Biodiversity and Pollution Crisis. Areas 1 and 2 require Tier A attention as they are the most significant amplifiers of **interrelated systems collapse.** Next several years present an opportunity. How to maximize my impact in the next *7-10/12 years.* Many paths forward exist but how to decide what will work quickly enough.

**Rating system.**

Contribution to a scale solution

Will it make an impact quickly enough

**Area 1**

Problem 1- Significant amount of carbon up there already that is gonna fuck things up for a while. Carbon half life 120 years, denser molecules much shorter (Methane 14ish years)

Problem 2- Fair amount of molecules going up each year which amplifies Problem 1. Hence, race to net zero.

**Area  2**

Problem 3- The web of nature/ our planetary life support is unraveling, quickly. Unsustainable agricultural and forestation practices. The encroachment of the human concrete and built environment into the furthest reaches of every ecosystem.

154isnd,Follow Up - fear’s properly settling in,"GIANT TW: Implied s*icide


Hi all

Many thanks for replying to my last post ‘Can I have my mental health back???’. I’m still here in Italy, but I’ve started to enjoy it after all the overwhelmingly supportive comments, I thank you all so much❤️


But, things took a turn today. Fear. Fear’s stricken me so much in the last 24 hours. As I said in my last post, i’m M17, and having talked to my family today abt my future, this whole fear spiral started. For the record, I know things very much aren’t going to be ok, but then when I talked about going to university to study Politics and seeing where I go after that, I felt an unbearable sinking feeling. If I want a future in university, it won’t amount to much. I may aswell not even bother… with life. This isnt necesserily s*icidal thoughts, but I very much worry it’ll come to that, perhaps in the near future. I want to live, I didn’t survive cancer for nothing, but now my hope is wearing dramatically thin. I keep seeing conflicting comments, some doomers, some pessimists, some optimists, and I just don’t know who to believe anymore, which just adds another layer of uncertainty and terror. And once again, my brain goes “having optimism is complicit, shame on you”. When I move out, I will do everything in my power to reduce my footprint, but why shoukd i bother… and it’s this that keeps me up at night, like right now. If it’s anything, I live in the UK, so I don’t know how much it will be affected, but still, im as petrified as a 17 year old can be. I keep telling myself that therell be no breakthrough, no wisespread action, and no relenting, and often that I dont deserve a future because of the system I live in, which, again, I fewr will lead me to thoughts of the S word

My main question is, Is there any optimism left? I beg of you all only to share good news if you have any, but I know thrres a limit to how “good” news can be at this point. I know feelings like this are rather cliche, but i need to get it out…


Thanks all


TLDR: Im petrified, but i dont want to give up my prospects, but that makes me feel complicit, and this dilemma has led me to reeeeally dark thoughts",9,4,2023-07-20 02:19:08,en,ClimateOffensive

Picture me, M17, wanting desperately to get involved in climate action and to actually be on the right side of history, feeling like I can’t enjoy my holiday in Italy because all the bad news about the climate is messing me up mentally. I’m reminded of it daily with the blistering heatwave, and i really dont want to turn my back on climate action while i’m here. I feel like if I relax here, on holiday, i’m being temporarily yet mortally complicit, and I don’t forgive myself. This is completely messing me up…


My question is, well there are two questions

A) Is this true? Am I being mortally and selfishly complicit here if I take my mind off it?

B) What the hell can I do while i’m here?

C) How else can I get involved? I’m very anxious about direct action, but i’m a keen singer, I find writing speeches natural, and i’m known to my local representative as he’s given me tickets to parliament several times, I can and have raised it with them

Hypha seems to be addressing the root of the climate problem. (1) They scale community-based climate organizations who are fighting the climate crisis through monetary subscriptions/donations. (2) Their funds go to supporting ongoing research and the development of new climate solutions through organizations like Project Drawdown, NDN Collective, Rewiring America and The Solutions Project. (3) And, again it's convenient.

I know that changing the way we eat, live, make things and move are crucial in the ways that we take climate action.

14qe7tx,Climate Action with Open-Source Abatement Plans - Need Your Insight!,"Hello everyone,

Time and again, we've seen businesses either deny the necessity of change or treat climate risk as little more than a reporting issue. Case in point, one of our global clients once revealed that they had a higher budget for office muffins than for managing climate risk!

We believe a key issue lies in the lack of transparency within the industry. Through our interactions with many SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative) participants, we've noticed that companies often sign off on climate plans without full transparency. The result? The public is led to believe the plans are effective, even when these companies miss or abandon their targets. 

So what does an ideal solution look like? According to scientists and ex-advisors of SBTi, it can only be credible if it's peer-reviewed by independent experts. However, the difficulty lies in balancing this need for verification with companies' reluctance to share confidential data. 

To solve this dilemma, we've come up with an approach we'd like your feedback on. Inspired by the open source community, we plan to compile effective climate solutions into open-source abatement plans for different sectors. Just like how browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge use the open-source Chromium as their foundation, companies can use these peer-reviewed plans as trustworthy references.

Our approach requires collective action and feedback from diverse perspectives. Hence, I'm excited to announce that we've created [https://www.rddi.org/](https://www.rddi.org/), an open platform where everyone, from any corner of the world, can either create climate solutions or craft reference implementation plans.

We will start adding implementable abatement plans for sectors this week or early next. Our goal is to create a community-owned resource, not influenced by any single entity - hence, while my firm 15Rock is funding this initiative, we hope to make it self-sustaining in the long run and governed by the community. 

We'd love to hear what you think! If there's anything similar out there or any aspects we should consider, let us know. Looking forward to your feedback, and thank you for your time!",3,1,2023-07-04 08:43:48,en,ClimateOffensive

14nfyop,“Best in Class” nonprofit organizations to give to,"Hey everyone, I very recently “took the blackpill” on climate change. I didn’t realize how bad things had gotten and that at this point we don’t have the tech needed to mitigate climate change. 

I’ve already set up recurring donations to several nonprofits for myself, but I think I can do a little more. 

I own a small accounting firm with about 700 clients. Preaching to them about changing their lifestyle realistically will just lose me business and not result in any change. Instead, I’m wanting to solicit donations from them, offering as low as $1 and up to whatever the client decides. I don’t feel it will amount to too much, but I have to try. If that fails, I’ll just eat the taxes and donate a portion of their invoice. 

There is just an incredible amount of information out there, so I’m hoping this sub can help me find a consensus on the best nonprofits to donate to in a couple of categories that I feel will have the greatest impact. 

I’m looking at:

-reforestation initiatives (i’m leaning toward eden project) 

-green energy development. I feel that nuclear is probably our best “bang for our buck” for keeping modern standards with less pollution. And a higher performing energy grid is necessary for EV’s to actually work. 

-carbon removal technology to clean the atmosphere 

-ocean initiatives, i’ve seen fertilization, growing certain ocean plants, and other plans but I have no idea which will provide the largest impact per dollar. 


With some luck, if this is well received, I can convince other professional firms in my area to pick this up as well. I feel like on top of trying to reduce my own carbon footprint that throwing money at those better equipped than I to help the environment is the best thing I can do. I have kids, and I want them to have a world to grow up in. Thank you all in advance, I’ll be looking over suggestions this weekend and will try to get something in place in the coming weeks.",18,5,2023-06-30 19:46:42,en,ClimateOffensive

Climate scientists and organizers have been sounding the alarm on the climate crisis for years. The latest findings from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tell us that regardless of what we do now, temperatures will still rise globally.

But, we still have time to mitigate damage to our most vulnerable communities by using the full power of the government to tackle the climate crisis head on. Fossil fuel CEOs are set to make near-historic profits this year, while working people have been navigating everyday life between a deadly pandemic—made worse by the Trump administration—unemployment and the worst effects of this crisis, from a record-breaking wildfire and hurricane season.

Scientists have told us exactly what we need to do to mitigate this crisis, but will we listen and respond?

144tndb,What would it actually take to set up plastic-eating culture tanks on a small level?,"We're constantly hearing about new bacteria, fungi, insects, etc. which have the ability to digest plastic and break it down into a better form, and yet it still doesn't seem to be happening to any appreciable degree. I've heard that the issue is scaling it and making it commercially viable. Fair enough. But what I'm wondering is, do we have plastic-digesting organisms which can handle plastic sufficiently that small groups could set up their own non-commercial plastic-digesting systems? Would it be viable to get some fermenting equipment, get access to bacteria which digest plastic, and set up neighborhood plastic-disposal tanks maintained on a small scale? What would the obstacles for that be, and could they be surmounted? Basically, are we at the point where this is doable, or is it a total dead end for the foreseeable future?

I know full well that it's way more important to reduce the amount of plastic waste generated in the first place, but there's enough already in existence that this feels worthwhile. I also feel like seeing the amount of work that goes in to breaking down plastic on a local level might help people to rethink unnecessary plastic usage, because it would be very ""in your face"" about it.

13v56jv,GLOBAL CALL FOR THE URGENT PREVENTION OF GENOCIDE OF THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN BRAZIL,"Portuguese abaixo)

Greetings relatives and allies, please review and sign the urgent petition below to prevent a genocide in Brazil. This petition was started by Yorenka Tasorentsi Institute under the guidance of Benki Piyãko, spiritual and political leader of the Ashaninká people of the Brazilian and Peruvian Amazon with an extremely important message from Nobel Peace Prize nominee Chief Raoni Metuktire of the Kayapo people of Brazil. Tomorrow the Brazilian Federal Congress will vote on Marco Temporal Bill 490/2007, this bill is an attempt to remove indigenous land rights in Brazil which would be a death sentence to the indigenous peoples of Brazil and constitute a deliberate attack to the territorial, physical, and cultural integrity of the original peoples of Brazil. 

Open letter from Yorenka Tasorentsi Institute-

13s9n5d,Bamboo seed balls,"Here's the thought process and sources:

So why bamboo?

Bamboo is insanely efficient and is a fast growing grass and researchers say that they're an extreme carbon sink and can produce massive amounts of oxygen (which means they can contribute to making desolate places rain more often which will help plants grow because you need oxygen to combine with hydrogen to make H2O lol).

According to Bamboo Batu:

""According to INBAR (the International Bamboo and Rattan Organization), a well-managed plantation of Moso bamboo can sequester about 32% more CO2 than an equal area of Chinese fir trees. Meanwhile, studies conducted in Colombia indicate that Guadua, a tropical clumping bamboo, can capture 60 tons per acre, about 58% more oxygen than trees. Dr. Barathi is a leading expert in bamboo botany and commercial cultivation based in India. ***According to his research, the tropical species Bambusa balcooa can sequester a total of about 88 tons of carbon dioxide per acre per year. Bamboo stores 24 tons of carbon, Barathi says, and releases 64 tons of oxygen per acre every year. This amount of oxygen is sufficient for 210 to 220 human beings to breathe for the whole year.***""

https://bambubatu.com/bamboo-and-oxygen-a-breath-of-fresh-air/

Nature.com states:

""On an average, one hectare of bamboo stands absorbs about 17 tonnes of carbon per year. However, the biomass production and the carbon-storing potential of the Indian bamboos are largely unexplored.

To find out, the scientists analysed and measured the percentage of carbon content in the culm (stem), sheath, branch and leaf. They also separately estimated the biomass of each of these components.

In BT, the carbon content was found to be the highest in the branch followed by the culm and leave components, whereas in DL the highest percentage of carbon was found in the culm followed by the branch and leave components.

***The average contribution of the different components in the total above-ground biomass of BT was 84 per cent by culm, 8.1 per cent by the branch and 7.1 per cent by leaves. In DL, it was 86 per cent by the culm, 8.7 per cent by the branch and 5 per cent by the leaves.***

***Bamboo plants, the researchers say, also have potential to convert barren lands into a fertile forest.***""

""***Soil loss remains one of the more overlooked global environmental issues. Almost a third of the world’s land is degraded, presenting a serious obstacle to feeding a growing population in the future. Restoring soil and preserving it for the future is an important 21st century challenge, and bamboo could play a major role.***

Bamboo is a remarkable plant for all kinds of reasons, but it is particularly well suited to land restoration projects. It has long root systems that can reach down deep, drawing up nutrients where other plants would struggle, so they can grow on poor soil or on steep slopes. Those roots bind the soil together and prevent further erosion, with a single bamboo plant able to bind six cubic metres of dirt.

It’s also very resilient. Because it builds up such a huge amount of biomass underground, it can quickly recover from damage, even if it is burned to the ground in a forest fire.

***Once the plant is established, it provides ground cover that helps to prevent run-off, helping to keep moisture in the soil and eventually replenishing groundwater. The leaf-drop begins to return organic matter to the soil, rebuilding fertility. It famously grows very fast, so bamboo can make a difference quickly.***""

For the Seedbombs aspect this will allow people to spread seeds without having to dig and bury the seeds like one would normally do, this being because the seeds are already covered and merely need to be dropped off.

https://www.epicgardening.com/how-to-make-seed-bombs/

Using bamboo will allow us to just throw the seeds -- well sow -- and just forget about them because bamboo is so resilient and will spread faster than wildfire because of the fact that they are a grass. Once they establish themselves they'll be good. Bamboo is the fastest growing plant on this planet!

The fastest species being:

*91 cm by Bambusa bambos observed at Kew Garden in England in 1855.*

I honestly think this is the best idea to fight climate change passively and give this planet more time... Hopefully.

Also with the rate they grow at, if strategically placed at say... Certain areas that pump out an extreme amount of carbon or asshole politicians, just secretively enough to hide them in such a way that are hard to notice until it's too late, bamboo can cause MAJOR PROPERTY DAMAGE!

13pjc4q,A continuation of questions answered by a climate scientist.,"Hey all. I asked a few more niche questions from a climate scientist, as a continuation of my previous post.

I've posted this in a more interview like and better format.

Enjoy.


Q1. ""Could you tell us in detail which RCP we're following?""

Ans: "" We aren't following a single RCP through and through. RCPs are scenarios, you don't copy-follow a scenario. You're question should be which RCP are we closest to? In my view, considering the fact that RCPs diverge in the mid 2020s, on the basis of their emissions scenarios, we'd follow RCP4.5 closely either a little above or below, probably above, emissions wise, concentrations depends on other elements. 

I think we'll land up around  ~ 2C degrees by 2100, maybe with overshoot. I'd say 1.8 to 2.2 is the range.  

Q2. ""RCP4.5 gets us to 2 -2.4 C, your range is a bit lower why?""

Ans: ""Negative emissions.""

Q3. ""Do you think DAC will ever scale up substantially?""

Ans: ""Depends on what you mean by substantially. I think it can go to a good enough level, and will play a key role, however, if you mean substantial as in we'll remove more than we emit at current levels, I.e. 40GT, I don't think that'd be possible by 2050. And I'm being mild here. Maybe 12-15GT, optimistically.

Q4. ""Net-Zero by 2050?""

Ans: ""I don't know, tad bit optimistic in my opinion. You're gonna need either zero emissions (not possible by 2050), or substantial reductions, such that negative emissions cancel them out. Now, that depends on stuff like scale and how much reduction can we really undergo in, 25 years. I hope it happens, but I'm unsure.""

Q5. ""Which areas of the world could be uninhabitable?""

Ans: ""There's a difference between survivability and liveability. I've heard some exaggerated examples of places/countries becoming uninhabitable. I read this paper which you shared, 

https://www.ft.com/content/072b5c87-7330-459b-a947-be6767a1099d

The first problem I have with this paper is that it doesn't specify what it's saying, the black areas have temps. greater than 28 degrees celsius. 6 - 28 degrees is the niche humans developed in. Humans in 10,000 BC ≠ Humans in 2023. Simple. With advancements, we can survive in most climates. 

The second is RCP 8.5. I agree that we shouldn't discount RCP 8.5, but in the paper, we also see a more plausible RCP 4.5, still bad, but not apocalyptic, mind you. No one focused on that.

RCP 8.5 thinks we'll keep emitting throughout the century and only increasing emissions. That won't happen. 

I'll discuss this more after you've ended your questions.



These assumptions miss out on 3 critical points.

1. Technology. Technology enabled us to survive on the moon. It sent us through deep oceans. It made areas previously uninhabitable, such as deserts, into bustling cities. IMHO we undermine how much tech can develop in 25 years time. 

2. Wealth. If you have wealth you can survive basically anywhere. Guys in hot nations have ACs. Guys in cold nations have heat pumps. Climate Change is, as much as I hate to say it, an engineering problem for the rich and middle class and a existential crisis for the poor.

3. Government Stability. If you have a government which has the capacity to enable desalination, geoengineer rains, etc. You're gonna be much better off. 

So it's not about uninhabitability, it's about engineering and suitability. You're still not gonna have people wanting to live in too hot areas.


Q6. ""Mass Migrations?""

Ans: "" Mass migrations will happen mostly intra-border. I don't see intra-border Mass migrations occuring. People often point to Syria, tell me how many reached Europe? Very small minority, most remained in Turkey. 

I'll take my native India for example. 

For India as a nation, it's an engineering crisis, not an existential one. For India's poor, unfortunately, it is an existential crisis, but for India, no. India has varied Koppen classifications, so you'll see population shuffling internally. And India has the money to geoengineer it's climate.

For less fortunate countries, it's about adaptability. If they can, they'll be spared.

For Small Island Developing Nations. I'm sorry.

Q 7. ""Is a Ministry For The Future like- scenario from the first chapter likely?

Ans: ""India-specific, I think unlikely,
 or not to that extent. I am affiliated with the government to an extent. They're already incrasingly aware of this and are developing Heat Action Plans. I've asked them to also include orders of dispersion, I.e leaving the area of natural catastrophe.

Wet Bulb reaching 35 Degree Centigrade, would need prolonged exposure to kill a healthy human. Prolonged meaning 6 hours, even under RCP8.5 we don't reach it. However, even lower wet bulb temps are still quite/significantly deadly, especially for the vulnerable. 

Not sure about the rest of the world.""

Q8. "" Are you optimistic or pessimistic? A few guys on reddit said you sounded optimistic.""

Ans: ""Me as an individual, I'm on neither side, I'm more go with the flow types. However, me as a climate scientist, I see a treacherous path but I'm confident we can find a way out.

From my experience, people tend to be immensely pessimistic about the climate crisis, I think with some good reason. For many people, life's not great, cost of living, ethnic and racial tensions, lack of money, and now this. This contributes to their nihilism. I'm not a science communicator, I' a scientist, I'm not going to be the best at words. 

I think a lot of their pessimism has to do with how the media handles the crisis. It obviously plays a role, and the media is notoriously bad at portraying the real picture. It'll either deny climate change or expel doomer narratives. My view is that doomerism/denialism are both sides of the same coin. Both peddled by the Fossil fuel industry.  Deniers will say it's normal and doomers will say nothing can be done, which both lead to weakened climate movements. Being realistic means that you recognise that the Earth is undergoing breakdown, but you also recognise that it's not imperative that we're f**cked. This breakdown is stoppable, repairable, and in some ways reversible. Don't fall pray to the Fossil industry's tactics of doom and denial. Outcry and make you voice be heard. That's how you solve this- very much in our hands- crisis.""

""Now for RCP 8.5 vs the rest of the RCPs. Bluntly, it's gonna be around RCP 4.5. RCP 8.5 & 2.6 are basically not possible now. Maybe 2.6 with solar geoengineering, which I do see happening soon enough. 

Feedbacks won't get us to RCP 8.5. There's no tipping point as such, only tipping elements which increase the burden on us.

However, 2.6 has also been stuck out by tragic delay IMHO, maybe we'll get to it. 1.9 was fantasy.

So RCP 4.5 is where we're headed. RCP 6 is also very unlikely in this era of decarbonization. But you cannot rule out RCP 6 concentrations wise.""

On many days, I receive messages about my writings from the Amazon with the Ashaninká tribe on Reddit. Today I am writing to personally invite you to Aniwa Gathering happening in in three weeks, from June 8-11 in Big Bear, California. 

Aniwa Gathering is an annual event of over 50 of the most prominent indigenous elders and leaders from throughout the world. This gathering has been talked about for generations throughout Indigenous traditions, of a time where the relatives from the north and south will meet, The Eagle and The Condor prophecy. That there will be a time that Indigenous peoples will come together, to fly the same sky, and unite humanity. We are in this time now, where peoples of all traditions are joined together, to go within for our own healing so we can step into the world as warriors for love, peace, and harmony. Indigenous people represent less than 5% of the world’s population yet are stewards for over 80% of the Earth’s biodiversity in the forests, deserts, grasslands, and marine environments, the elders of Aniwa are committed to sharing the next steps for to repair our climate for the next generations. 

This profound opportunity will give you access to elders, guides, and world leaders including Nobel Peace Prize nominee Kayapo Chief Raoni Metuktire and Indigenous world leader, Benki Piyãko Ashaninká who has planted over three million trees. Ceremonies, talks, and musical performances will be lead by Kayapo, Ashaninká, Huni Kuin, Maya, Achuar, Apache, Aruaco, Kogi, Wiwa, Cheyenne, Hawaiian, Hopi, Dogon, Diné(Navajo), Toronto O’Odham, Waurá, Yoeme, Apache, Mayo Yoreme, Thunghutti, Yawanawá, Nnde, Caluilla, Manohoac, and more. The works begin with an opening ceremony lead by Native American elders whose tribes are of the lands we will gather on and continue for four days to a powerful closing ceremony where we pray in unison. 

All ceremonies and activities are included, sweat lodges, a Huni Kuin Hampaya ceremony to open the voice for singing and expression, Amazonian body paint for protection, Maya love ceremony, Cheyenne ear piercing, rapé ceremonies, and more from over 50 indigenous elders participating this year from tribes of every corner of the Earth. Entheogenic medicines will not be served or offered in this time. Elders will use their many modalities for healing and offer incredible opportunities to build relationships with them to visit their lands. There are also opportunities for private one on one healings with elders. 

The gathering is held on a beautiful ranch in Big Bear in pristine nature with wild horses. There are options for camping, RV camping, glamping, and airbnb close by. Food trucks that offer various healthy options for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks are available. 

This is the first year we are able to open space for the Reddit community before we reach capacity. The works of these elders are powerful and healing. The funds from the event are distributed to the tribes in attendance. Please feel free to ask me anything about the gathering.

13dpv90,I talked with a climate scientist. Here's what I learned.,"(For privacy reasons I'll not reveal specific details)

Things I got to know:- 

1. 1.5 C is possible but he doesn't see it happening. 2 C is increasingly likely now, post 2020 due to policy improvements, as per him.


2. The internal climate community is worrisd but has become more optimistic due to increased public awareness and better policy. He told me that just a few years ago, many clinate scientists broke down thinking about the future, now many of them are becoming more optimistic, cautiously though.


3.  I asked him about Solar Geo-engineering as I'm a proponent of it. He told me that while it's an uneasy topic, he thinks that we'll use it by mid 2030s, since there's a chance we may breach 1.5 C by then. I asked about consequences, he told me they're being studied, and can't be sure of them. (His expertise is not solar geo-engineering but he has a friend who is a researcher in the field.) 


4. Enhanced rock weathering is great, if done properly, and will probably be the biggest carbon sink if utilised correctly. However, it'll be needed to be subsidized quite heavily. 


5. I asked him about carbon capture and scale, he says that while it's probable that carbon capture will scale substantially, leaving the CO2 in the ground is the best way to remove CO2.


6. I asked him about feedbacks from the climate. He told me that they'll be minute compared to human emissions and humans emissions through and through are the main cause. He says that somethings happening faster than expected are worrying, but more worrying are human emissions.


7. I asked him how many people could suffer. There was an uneasy silence that followed. He said depends, but he said he couldn't be sure. 


8.  I asked him whether climate change is reversible? He said, some aspectssuch as heat and co2 in the atmosphere, are reversible and co2 won't take millennia as was considered the case, with innovation in the capture industry, however, sea level rise and ice sheets melting are things that will absolutely not reverse in our lifetimes.


9. I asked him if AI could help. He said he doesn't know, and wouldn't rely on just AI.


10. I asked him if we've made progress. He said absolutely. We've made good progress, but it should happen much much faster, and he couldn't stress enough on the faster, because that'll make things exponentially better. He said that he sees 2018 as a turning points where renewables and EVs really began being adopted.


11. I asked him about peak emissions. He said that 2025-2027 is most likely peak emissions. 


12. I asked him about RCPs and which one we'll follow, and he told me that he'd no attach any preference to any single RCP, but he does consider RCP 4.5 the upper limit, although that's uncertain given some conditions.


13. I asked whether we as individuals have an impact? He said not much, most pollution is in the hands of industries, the consumer, when in a collective group, can then only influence industry policies, as we've seen. He said protests and outcry is the biggest way we can have more influence. 


14. I asked him about meat, and he agreed that stopping meat would help stop substantial co2 emissions, however, that's still only a portion. Most meat emissions of co2 come from other sources, like logistics and etc. 


15. I asked him whether we, as the unknowing public should be optimistic? He said probably, but cautiously, he's told me that we should be excited about innovations but not be dependent on them, and that there's still a hard parh ahead. 


If you guys want me to ask him anything else, tell me in the comments, and I'll try.


Edit: About the meat part, he said most meat emissions come from other sources for example logistics, not just logistics itself. Most meat emissions from from farm/industrial methods. Meat is absolutely an issue and I apologise for the wording above which may have made it seem otherwise.

As a bit of background I've taken quite a few steps to minimise my personal climate impact (and I realise that we need systemic as well as individual change). But there are two main areas I haven't addressed yet. Decarbonising my home heating (might be a few years before I can save up for this)and my job.

I'm a gardener and I drive more miles than I'd like travelling to customers. And quite a few of my customers effectively want me to 'manicure' their gardens which isn't helpful for biodiversity. So I feel like I'm emitting co2 in my job to in many cases do something that I don't think should be done. I'm always looking for customers closer to home and with gardens that are more nature friendly but I don't  have enough of these customers to keep me fully employed. When I replace my van I don't think I'll be able to afford an electric van without wiping out my profit.

Should I be changing jobs?

I am requesting that you call your state reps and governors and ask that a law be created to encourage biodiversity in areas that have been interrupted by human activity. 

Unless someone can recommend something else, I am asking that for every 5 square feet 7+ plant species must be present and for every 15 square feet an additional 7 more native plants need to be present or planted, including a variety of trees.

I am requesting that we restrict mowing only to areas with high volumes of foot traffic (both publicly and privately—an entire lawn for aesthetic reasons is not justifiable). 

Request the limitation of mowing to very specific dates of the year, to encourage wildflower growth, to reduce carbon production and fossil fuel consumption, and to help the bees, butterflies and more biodiversity.

Also remind them about the Paris Agreement our dedication to reduce carbon and that mowing more than we need to, produces more carbon and consumes fossil fuel at a much higher rate. 

I also think it’s good to request that next generational planting be done alongside older growth in interrupted areas at the quarter and half cycle of each tree (way before a tree falls sick or becomes an issue (but not to remove the sick tree until it does indeed become an issue).

Request that for any tree removed, that 10 varied trees be planted in close proximity to one another and that they are planted within the same zip code and/or ecosystem. 

Request that tree varieties vary in rows when planting in strips (not all of the same tree on a block, they should vary and alternate). Three trees, three varieties. 

Request that towns plant more densely (it’s okay if the branches touch and break)

Request that no raking/removal of leaves be done for a percentage of property to encourage soil production, ground coverage, warmth and habitat for hibernating animals; and to restore water tables. What do we think is fair to nature here? 80% of exposed property not be raked?

Protection of seed producing trees. It often takes trees 20-30 years to mature and they are usually removed because of their mess, and people’s fear of their car becoming slightly dinged up. These trees should be honored over our vehicles’ appearances and other “justifications.”

I fail to understand how someone who does not need a car (in cities with good public transit in europe) can declare with passion that they will never let go of their fossil fuel car and hate on electric cars, how people still claim they can't live without having meat everyday etc.   
And worst of all, I just don't know how to deal with this in a productive way. Is there something I can do to make a more green lifestyle look more desirable or something? How can we make people in our personal surrounding understand that they need to change something, without increasing the overall hate and anger? How can we counter the framing that conservative parties use that everything green will cause misery, scarcity and distress?  
How can we tell a new story, that climate action, no matter the scale, is positive and desirable?",68,58,2023-04-24 05:27:35,en,ClimateOffensive

12sy42c,Seeking advice how to get started,"Hi All,

I've been suffering from anxiety related to the decline of nature and climate change since my teens. In my twenties I finally had the courage to switch education and careers into the environment field, but academia turned out to be more about a toxic pyramid scheme than actually doing good for the world. Unfortunately, I recently got into some health issues and realised my time here might be shorter than I expected and there's no time to lose. It really made me take a cold hard look at where my efforts are going and how to better prioritise my life.

Through my friends, we are working on putting together a team and project to plant trees in Bhutan. Could anyone please advise on how we can spread the word and set up avenues to raise funds? Alternatively, can anyone propose a financially sustainable model for us to scale up our conservation projects? I'm not too good with the finance side of things. Our projections show it takes about 2500 USD to plant 1000 native trees using local communities.

&#x200B;

Thank you",47,19,2023-04-20 09:08:45,en,ClimateOffensive
12spbxk,Resource to show a path to electric aircraft,"The aviation industry isn't taking electrification seriously, instead they are focused on longer flights that are even more difficult to electrify. This [blog](https://www.element84.com/blog/what-electric-plane-range-is-needed-to-electrify-us-domestic-air-travel) and [interactive site](https://electricflights.azavea.com/) show that there is a potential path to electrifying a good amount of continental US air travel.

For those advocating to specific airports you can click on a city/airport - say LAS (Vegas) then it will show you the stats for just that airport.  For example 41% of flights to/from Vegas could be replaced by electric with range of 460 miles. That's 1.5 million passengers a month.

[Climate Defiance](https://www.climatedefiance.org/) is planning to block the White House Correspondence Dinner to protest against the Biden Administration's disastrous recent approval of the Willow Project and auctioning off a massive area in the Gulf of Mexico for drilling. 

We are too far within the climate crisis to be approving new 30-year oil and gas leases, not to mention the untold harm it poses to those ecosystems. 

If you're near Washington D.C., please consider joining this action. Otherwise, spreading the news or providing resources/ funding goes a long way for our soldiers on the ground. The White House Correspondence Dinner draws a great deal of media attention so is a great chance to spotlight this issue and reach individuals around the country.

12iaa0w,Opening accounts with fossil free banks,"I’ve recently learnt that many banks use the money deposited with them to invest in fossil fuel projects. This is something that I don’t support, so I’ve been looking into green banks that don’t fund fossil fuels and instead use the money to invest in projects that contribute to a sustainable future.

I’ve already got a good idea for my checking account, but I am a little lost on my savings. The account that I’ve been using is a high yield account, and it’s a nice bonus. I’m completely willing to forfeit this if it means not giving money to that bank, but I started thinking. I couldn’t find much of anything on the internet, so I turned to here.

The highest I’ve found is an APY of 2.53% offered by greenpenny bank here: https://www.greenpenny.bank/Personal-Services/Savings-CDs

That being said, I was wondering if anyone knew of anything that might be a little higher than that. The one I’ve been using is Marcus by Goldman Sachs, offering an APY of 3.75%.

Currently on list is:    


***Online databases/interactive maps***

* [ClimateJetsProject](https://climatejets.org/)\- An online database where visitors can see the climate emissions of owners of private jets around the world. Users will see the statistics- including how many flights using how many aircrafts, how much time + miles are spent flying and how much jet fuel used well as how much CO2 is emitted. Other information includes frequent destinations and international travel locations that private jet owners go to 
* [EJAtlas](https://ejatlas.org/) \- collects stories of communities struggling for environmental justice from around the world. It aims to make these mobilization more visible, highlight claims and testimonies and to make the case for true corporate and state accountability for the injustices inflicted through their activities. It also attempts to serve as a virtual space for those working on EJ issues to get information, find other groups working on related issues, and increase the visibility of environmental conflicts
* [Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/) \- online platform that provides data and tools for monitoring forests. By harnessing cutting-edge technology, GFW allows anyone to access near real-time information about where and how forests are changing around the world.
* [Native Land Map](https://native-land.ca/) \- global map where users can type in their address, city or zipcode and find out what native land they are on. Users can also just scroll through the map and see what the various indigenous territories around the world are 
* [Open Climate](https://openclimate.network/) \- Allows users to navigate emissions inventories and climate pledges of different actors at every level, aggregating data from various public sources for countries, regions, cities and companies. Users can search for the country and region of their choosing, and see their carbon emmissions, the percentage of the worlds overall population that the country is responsible for and what their carbon pledges are.  Users can also look into climate impact + pledges of specifc companies. 
* [Tree Equity Score](https://treeequityscore.org/about/) \-  An online, visual, map database where visitors can input their city and then see how much treecover their neighborhood has compared to surrounding areas. Provides a number score from 0-100 
* [Audobon Society Native Plant Database](https://www.audubon.org/native-plants)\- Online database where visitors can input their zipcode and find what plants are native to their area if they wanted to start planting native plants. Focuses on native plants that are good for birds- but can be used for pollinators as well.

I am open to adding other sheets that cover other types of resources that I might not have here, I just haven't figured out what they should be yet.    
If you know of any or are working on any yourself that you think should be added to this list that were not mentioned above, please comment. I am hoping to bring all these resources into one centralized places because I find all these cool things but they haven't been wrangled into one location (to my knowledge??)",42,8,2023-03-29 16:53:14,en,ClimateOffensive

Please share and include any other job boards below!!  Instead of posting stuff like  like "" You can find stuff on Indeed/LinkedIn/GlassDoor etc"". I think it would be a lot more helpful to share what sort of things you are typing into the search bars to help others know what sort of things they should be looking for.   


If you want, start looking for jobs in the climate space- there are many out there!! [And plenty of people who have absolutely ZERO background in science are getting hired.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-01-05/how-to-quit-your-job-to-fight-climate-change) The climate sector knows that we need more and more and more people. So yeah you might not be qualified for all jobs, but there are plenty of jobs that WILL take you. MANY have the mentality of skills can be learned- passion and genuine care for the planet can not be.  
Also, there are plenty of climate organizations and businesses that still need regular admin stuff, backend tech needs etc. So there is still plenty of opportunity to do something you already know how to do just for a job in the environmental/climate space.

The most important thing about the environmental/climate space is NOTHING is a silver bullet solution, for every suggestion that works for one person/community/country/biome, it won't work for others. It doesn't make it not valid, it just makes it not the solution for that person/community/country etc.

I am always looking for ways that I can do something concrete about climate change. One thing that I overlooked for a while is where I was doing my banking. There many banking institutions that continue to contribute in significant ways to the climate disaster. Topping the list is JP Morgan chase. JP Morgan in particular is having an annual shareholder meeting in late spring (April or May) in which shareholders will be able to vote on a proposal to end any expansion of lending for new fossil fuel projects. It doesn’t cover existing funding, but it’s a step in the right direction. I am considering buying one share in order to be able to vote (and selling right after). This could be more immediately effective than protesting outside the bank, because let’s face it they only respond to a couple things- one being money leaving their bank and two being shareholder pressure.

11wv8v3,How to overcome cynicism and actually get large scale change moving.,"So the IPCC released it's report and I need to vent:

I know that change needs to happen on a large scale. Yes, our individual choices and local activism matters, but they don't mean much if the same systems are in place still doing their thing on a large scale. 

But large scale change is intimidating. And with so many groups with so many interests, it seems all too likely solutions will be stalled by  big oil, politics, government bureaucracy, dis and misinformation, different interest groups, and a whole bunch of arguments over which solutions are the most ""Anti-capitalist"" and ""Progressive."" 

And then there's the fact that I feel cynical about most forms of activism. Obviously voting, petitioning, writing and so on have both merits and limitations; but i've seen people  chain themselves to construction equipment to stop pipelines and seen the pipelines be built anyways. 

So what are we supposed to do??  How do we overcome cynicism ang get change on a large scale?",69,8,2023-03-20 16:44:30,en,ClimateOffensive

Some of these policy returns are far from guaranteed; if we do [all the things to the max but achieve no technological gains in carbon removal or zero-carbon energy](https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=23.2.1&p1=110&p7=100&p10=5&p16=-0.03&p23=30&p30=-0.07&p39=250&p47=5&p50=5&p53=100&p55=100&p57=-10&p59=-100&p63=8.8&p235=2.5&p65=100), we're looking at 1.6 ºC (2.9 ºF), even with maximal economic growth.

11pod9f,How people of Serbia won a battle again our government and big companies.,"For those who don't know, in Serbia people are fighting constantly in the past year for the clean air, soil, water, you name it. And last year we won s huge battle. Im writing this here because I don't think this made some huge headlines in the world, but it is big news. Not just for us, but so you guys should know that protests have the impact. 

So, the story goes like this.

Serbia is designated to be a sacrificial zone in the world for the mining of lithium. We all know that the lithium is good for the cars of the future, but the problem here is that the companies that wanted to mine it here, wanted to use cheap methods to extract it from the ground and those cheap methods are dirty methods that will pollute the ground and water for ages. 
I personally know some people that were paid to sell some of their land for the testing of the ground, and all the water wells in the area are polluted now and really unusable. 
So people organized and started blocking the highways, bridges and thus cities. 
The protests grew, opposition joined, new green political groups are formed, they entered the government  and after a while our PM backed down. 
It happened after Novak Djokovic kinda backed those ideas.

So yeah, this is huge. 

People won the battle against our corrupt government who wanted to sell our lithium no matter the cost, and people just said no and won. 

For those interested, Google ""sacrificial zone Serbia""

th0fr2,Court overturns ruling on protecting children from climate change harm. What is your thought on this?," An Australian court on Tuesday overturned a groundbreaking ruling from last year that required the country’s environment minister to consider harm to children from climate change before approving a coal mine.

The full Federal Court decided unanimously in favour of the appeal by Environment Minister Sussan Ley against a judge’s ruling that she had a duty of care to avoid harming children when weighing approval for a coal project. The court ruled ""the duty should not be imposed upon the Minister"".

The original ruling, which related to approval of a coal mine extension in the state of New South Wales, was seen as setting a precedent for other mine applications. Ms Ley approved the mine, run by Whitehaven Coal, last September ahead of the appeal. The case was brought by eight schoolchildren and a nun seeking to require Australia’s environment minister to protect children from future harm caused by climate change.

Some of the children had gathered outside the court in Sydney to await the ruling and were left in tears when the decision was announced.",2,1,2022-03-18 08:43:02,en,ClimateCrisis

The climate emergency is upon us. Extreme weather events that previously occurred once in a lifetime now take place regularly around the globe. People of the Global South and communities of color have felt the heaviest blows. Meanwhile, fossil fuel companies continue to rake in billion-dollar profits annually, and the policies of Biden, like Trump and Obama before him, fail to substantively address the crisis; instead, they punish workers, migrants, and the poor.  
So, what's the way out? How can we build an internationalist and anti-racist climate movement? What does Marxism offer for our understanding of this historic crisis?

Join **Left Voice** for a six-week Study Circle beginning TOMORROW, February 1st, to discuss these questions and others. Meetings will be held on alternate Tuesdays at 7:30pm EST.

rvesbm,Would you kill a child?,"Context: I live in Australia

Video to share, not just on meat though, so I’d think I’m going to talk about it a little, would you kill a child? Rhetorical question, cause people are voting for parliament this year again, yet both parties dislike a “0 C02 emissions target by 2030” and instead are focusing on the economics, I think it’s time to say stfu (shut the fuck up) about money, if all you care about is money, you won’t be very happy. Now I know this post could be deemed as “hate speech” or “misinformation” but you gotta realise that our government is messed up, at this point I’ll go with the greens, cause would you rather have a healthy future or deathly troubles? Instead of money focus on sustainable futures

TACKLING THE CLIMATE CRISIS IN REALITY

…

What was once global warming became climate change and what has become climate change is now known as the climate crisis. Weighing up international politics for the English speaking countries we can see what is occurring right in front of our eyes, whenever we turn on the television. A blatant disregard for what the world has essentially evolved into. Which is a complete and utter catastrophe. Right now, on the island of Java, the Indonesian mainland. We have a volcano erupting that is essentially erupting because of the weather exposure of recent floods. Meanwhile we are faced with COVID pandemic, which atrocious when we consider the world facts over the past four to eight years. It’s become a blatant disregard for the reality of the world. We have the Aung Sung Suu Kyi facing imprisonment in Myanmar where the military junta has once again seized power, floods and weather hazards occurring world-wide, and the cyber hacking of the American presidential system. Which would effectively be the worst case of terrorism world-wide when you consider it’s global impact. Authorities in power are still reeling about all of the damage that has occurred on an international basis. The AUKUS agreement has ensured some level of stability in the respect to the Chinese influence.

But what we must confront is the very possible elimination of the entire species by climate change. I’ve been doing just that for the past couple of months. And although it’s been a reeling experience, I have taken away some valuable lessons. No, confronting the mental apparition of the end of the world is not the end of the world. It’s how we choose to respond to these things that shape our very next pivotal steps. COVID was essentially just the beginning of the end. The end, in the end, is the end.

What we see on our television screens at home is essentially mind-numbing entertainment that plays mockery to everything that we hold as a characteristic of truth. Yes, we are receiving snippets of the climate change threat. But either the media are too afraid to show the viewing public what is actually occurring in the fight against climate change, or they are conserving an ultra privileged position while making mockery of the way the rest of us have to live our lives, the other option is that they’re attempting to protect the public by preserving a level of sanity (something that has not been witnessed in the face of COVID). So, which one is it? A, B, C or D? It hardly matters which. At this time we must be confronting the issues of climate change at least in a mental perception in order to best deal with everything that occurs. What should we actually be doing now?

\- Conscription into emergency services. (Fire and natural disaster response services)

\- General re-structuring of services 

\- Shutting down any remaining fossil fuel energy sources (electricity or life?)

\- Rationing and preserving all natural life

\- Joint diplomatic response on a global scale (Yes, they’ve already done that…)

\- Putting aside all feuds and economic concerns as a minor category when faced with the threat of extinction.

That would just be the beginning of my list of things to do. But yet when you ask the lay-person on the street. Your neighbor for example. What do they think of the climate change crisis? They’re too numbed down with a collective group will of determining their world to be completely positive, that they forget about the difference between critical and toxic. And really in the end of all this toxic culture wars and rhetoric, isn’t the idea of a toxic culture just a general reaction to a species faced with its own extinction?

A bit of pop philosophy in regards to this equation. Is the end of the world such a bad thing? Or is it a world where the vast majority of it’s population were subservient and the harsh realities of poverty and slavery outside were replaced with a picturesque scene of daffodils in a glass jar next to some peaches. The truth is most of the world’s hands got slapped away rather than being able to grasp the succulent peach. Even if the peach was only just a painted picture. Ooo…. Gotta get me some of those peaches. I apologize, I was distracted by the peaches. Which was really cruel because they were simply painted and didn’t actually exist. They were just another torture devised by the insidious human mind. And with all of these insidious tortures forced on the lay person? Is the end of existence such a bad thing?

I wouldn’t worry too much… They’re all quite capable people in charge. They’ll have a plan. But as for the rest of us… What’s the common folk going to do about it all except prattle on? Maybe join one of these volunteer disaster relief services. Hopefully…",2,0,2021-12-07 11:29:24,en,ClimateCrisis

r0lxiz,Protest the exploration of oil and gas reserves on South Africa's Wild Coast,"The rugged Wild Coast of South Africa is a region of unparalleled beauty and biodiversity. Every year, billions of sardines move north along this unspoiled coastline, attracting and sustaining sharks, dolphins, sailfish, whales and other marine life. Now, in the wake of the COP26 climate conference where leaders agreed on the urgent need for action, a seismic survey of the area is about to begin in hopes of finding new oil and gas deposits under the seafloor. Beyond the immediate damage caused to marine life by the destructive and incredibly loud seismic air guns, the exploitation of further fossil fuel reserves in an environmentally sensitive area goes against all common sense when considering the intertwined climate and biodiversity crises.

Together with eyeforce OceansNotOil, parley.tv and sentinelocean, Ocean Collective documented the arrival of Shell’s survey ship and will support raising awareness and local efforts in the upcoming weeks.

What does a seismic survey look like?

For the next 5 months every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, the vessel is firing loud shock waves into the sea bed which could have detrimental effects on one of the most beautiful marine ecosystems in the country.

qq6rgb,"We are Done Waiting, a progressive organization fighting for progressive policy and candidates around the country","We are a group that advocates for and endorses progressive candidates and policies. We endorse progressive candidates and help them in elections by making thousands of calls to voters on their behalf. 

We also pressure centrist politicians that are already in office into supporting policies like Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, Debt-Free College, and getting corporate money out of politics. 

We’re sick of half-measures and incremental changes that do nothing to help average, working-class people. We’re tired of being told to wait for reforms that are long overdue, especially when we’re running out of time for bold, comprehensive action on issues like climate change or the student debt crisis. 

We will never refuse to endorse a progressive candidate based on who their opponent is. We refuse to ignore those that are in races against powerful people, as these are often some of the most important races to be won.

We will rescind an endorsement if a candidate backs an establishment candidate over a progressive, if they take any corporate money, or if they compromise the progressive values that we endorsed them for in the first place.

We’re sick of a status quo that only works for the wealthy and the elite.

In our first 2 months, we made 60,000 calls (without a dialer) for Adam Christensen, a progressive candidate that ran in Florida’s 3rd Congressional District in 2020. Since then, we have also made calls to constituents urging them to call their representatives to get them to support the Green New Deal, and we have also made calls in Georgia to get people to register and vote in the runoff election. 

After that we began making calls to voters to increase support for Medicare For All. Most recently, we worked on behalf of Nina Turner’s congressional campaign. In our first week phone banking for her campaign, our phone bankers made 28,649 calls on her behalf and they made over 600,000 calls for her overall.

If these issues interest you and you would like to learn more about us, you can visit our website at [this link](https://www.donewaiting.org/). 

There you can find more information about us and the policies that we support, as well as the candidates we have endorsed. If someone you know is looking for an endorsement, they can apply for one there as well.

You can also apply to volunteer to help us carry out our mission. This is an entirely volunteer-run organization, and we welcome anyone that would like to volunteer their time to fight for these policies. You can meet plenty of other young, like-minded progressives from all over the country, and the application only takes about 30 seconds. The application can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mRJ_81wYDz0j1BN8WUzuJHn9K7VsPqBbcO0XjIWIhJc/viewform?edit_requested=true).

g62mq8,I am Solomon Rajput and I’m running for US Congress in Michigan,"I am running a grassroots campaign against an 85-year political dynasty in MI-12, and I am fighting for progressive policies such as a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, Tuition Free College and Eliminating Student Debt, and Getting Corporate Money Out of Politics.

The biggest reason that I decided to run was climate change. Our environment and economy will be ravaged by climate change if we do not act before we run out of time.That’s why I support enacting a Green New Deal so that we can begin to mobilize our economy away from our dependence on fossil fuels and create millions of green energy jobs. Climate change is not an issue that our current politicians can continue to ignore and I’m done waiting for action.

I am taking a leave of absence from medical school to run because I am done waiting on our current politicians to act on issues like climate change or enacting single-payer healthcare. Previously, I worked as an organizer for the Democrats in the 2016 presidential election. I also founded a group called the Michigan Resistance, a political activist group that made thousands of calls to stop bad legislation in the Michigan State Legislature.

I am also a part of the Rose Caucus, a group of anti-establishment Democratic Socialist and Socialist candidates running for various offices across the United States.

If you would like to learn more about me, donate to support our campaign, or join our fellowship program (which is completely remote), you can go to my website, [SolomonRajput.com](https://www.solomonrajput.com/) . We’re always looking for more volunteers nationwide that would like to help us do phone banking or text banking.

You can also check out my social media where we post campaign updates, policy updates, event invites, announcements, jokes, and memes.

My team and I have also put together a list of COVID-19 resources located on my website for all those who are in need during this pandemic. Although much of it is specific to MI-12, there are resources that extend to the whole state of Michigan listed there. Feel free to check it out here: www.solomonrajput.com/coronavirus

Just a test right now, but most likely not for long. The reason they are used again? Mainly because of catastrophies which will follow the climate change, according to the cities.
I havent found any English sources, but i can link you some german ones if you care. I think its wild that these sirens were not used for at least 30 years and are now in use again, as climate change is a threat as big as the last war.",6,0,2018-09-06 04:17:03,en,ClimateCrisis

1. Theoretically, shouldn't conservatives support reducing federal subsides to the fossil fuel industry, due to the emphasis on limiting government spending? I understand there's big money involved that may prevent republicans from passing such legislation, but if they openly reject this proposal, wouldn't it essentially ""out"" them as being in the fossil fuel industry's pocket? Could asking republicans about whether or not they support this proposal be a good ""test"" to demonstrate if they are bought?

2. There's some talk about a revenue-neutral carbon tax. But I was wondering, since climate change is so important, why not take it a step further and go with a revenue-negative carbon tax?

70ycku,Make My Idea: ClimateMarket.com,"# Make My Idea: ClimateMarket.com

There’s few things conservatives love more than [free markets][1] and [climate science denial][2], so why not put them together? 

ClimateMarket.com lets you put your money where your mouth is, and bet real money on the simple question: 



> Will it be hotter this year than last year? 



## How's it work?

It would work like a stock market, but rather than betting on the performance of corporations, **you're simply betting whether it'll be hotter or cooler this year than it was last year**. It seems like a pretty safe bet, considering that [13 of the 14 hottest years in recorded history have happened in the last 17 years][3], but that's only true if you *believe what thermometers say*. 



I see this as a ""put up or shut up"" test for conservatives who would rather change the climate conversation to debunked talking points designed to cast [fear, uncertainty, and doubt][4]. It's also a way for people, *whoever they might be*, to materially profit off the willful ignorance of the [48% of Americans who are skeptical of climate science][5].



I had the idea while watching a political talk show where the conservative guest talked over all the other panelists, hogging time without making any real arguments. I dreamed of just being able to ask them ""do you bid on ClimateMarket.com?"" Then SHUT. UP. 



## Technical details

Of course, depending on how deep you want to go, the market could simply follow the one global temperature, but this might limit the site to being simply a rhetorical punchline that doesn't actually attract a vibrant market of bidders/bettors. OF COURSE it would always pay to the people who bet on red (HOT), and no serious climate denier would even mess with it.  

It could be truly robust if you could get granular and let people bet on the climate fluctuations in their own home town — by year, by month, etc. You could let people bet against the previous year, the historical average temp for that location, comparing their location with other locations, and on and on. 

This idea could actually generate interesting data about the future of climate change if it begins to foster a vibrant trading community. Much like the [DARPA FutureMAP program][6] in the early 2000s, betting patterns may surface ""insider information"" that would be otherwise unavailable and could be used to more effectively fight climate change. 



## Make my idea

So if you have the technical ability and the time to create what I'm talking about, please consider this post as your unlimited [CC0 license][7] to take this idea and run with it. Please build it, please spread it far and wide, and please shoot me a link when it exists!

3dumd1,The Absurdity of Reducing Carbon Consumption/A Case for Biomass Harvesting,"First off I'd like to let everyone know that I am a noob in this board so if this is not the most original thing ever proposed already, pardon me.
Carbon exist on earth in 3 different forms mainly: carbon dioxide, fossil fuel, and biomass.
In prehistoric times the climate was high in CO2, and then came along photosynthesis, which converts CO2 into biomass, thus the climate composition changed to a more favorable form for thermal living beings.
Over the course of times, some biomass was being trapped and buried into fossil fuels in a very slow and gradual manner to a very significant proportion. This wasn't taped in until a few hundreds of years ago, as our energy source was always from biomass. 
So, up until the first drop of oil/coal was burned in an industrious manner, there was an equilibrium between photosynthetic process and the consumption of biomass/biocarbon via eating and burning plants/animals, along with the accumulation of fossil fuel at such a slow rate that is insignificant to mankind.
And then comes the energy revolution, which reversed the accumulation of fossil fuel in an extraordinary rate that we are at the risk of running out.
So, think about it this way, the only change in the equation is the rapid net loss of fossil fuels (and also deforestation, which reduces the rate of the conversion from CO2 to biomass which I'll address in a bit), and how do we restore the equilibrium? The proposal so far is to ""use less"". (I'm aware carbon harvesting is already been proposed but it has not gathered nearly the momentum it should.) In order to restore the previous position that humans (animals evolve and adapt, humans don't, humans are the only concern in this scenario, except for biodiversity, which is too broad a topic to address now) are comfortable with would require the rate of accumulation in fossil fuel to be larger than the consumption of it, and for us to burn less fuel than the rate of fossil fuel formation would mean that 1 light bulb for per person would be an unaffordable luxury. So clearly, the only way to reduce atmospheric carbon is to harvest biomass. Think about it, if you stop having income, the solution would not be skipping breakfast, you will need to find a job.
Which leads us back to the beginning of the story, what popped up out of the blue from a hot CO2 rich earth to lead us here? As far is I know it is mostly attributable to algae, and it is as simple an answer as there can be. Dump a load of iron in the oceans, and wait for it to work. Yes, it will upset the ecosphere like an algal boom, but the ocean is vast so something is bound to be able to survive that. Also, the best part is that if it all goes wrong, we can just torch the weeds and use it for energy directly, since the carbon is taken from the atmosphere anyway, we aren't really adding anything into the air.
I seriously think that the ""reducing carbon footprint"" thing is the dumbest idea ever, switching from a V12 to a Prius is like putting a thumb on a slit carotid artery, it is just a pretense, and to think about the premium we are paying to switch from an extremely fast way to kill the planet to a very fast way is absurd to me. It is blatantly obvious when its shown in a diagram.

Now, I've read a lot about this - many of those emails, the hacked documentation of that software, countless columns of various talking heads, scientists, skeptics, critics, and other people with opinions, but I still don't understand the key point. Maybe I'm dense - I don't know.
    
Who stands to benefit from perpetuating a anthropogenic global climate change myth? Politicians losing tax dollars from economies inhibited by energy rationing? Renewable-energy execs rivaling the power of the petroleum fuel industry and all the world's sheiks and oil barons? Mad scientists requesting money for increasingly accurate instruments with which to measure non-existent results?

154q8w7,Respekt und Sachlichkeit als Grundlage des Austauschs in diesem Sub. Oder: Warum wir jetzt strenger moderieren.,"Liebe Klimawandel-Community.

Im letzten Monat hat sich die Zahl der Nutzer und Nutzerinnen hier im Sub vervielfacht. Während es hier lange recht ruhig war, ist hier nun oft sehr viel los, teils zig oder gar hunderte Kommentare. Das ist toll! 

Jedoch: Oft sind die Diskussionen sehr aufgeheizt, unsachlich und respektlos. Wir wollen hier daher künftig stärker moderieren und wollen Euch hier unsere Gedanken dazu vorstellen.

**Der Klimawandel ist Realität und eine riesige Herausforderung für die Menschheit.**

Dies ist die Grundlage dieses Subs: Der Klimawandel ist real und mit allergrößter Wahrscheinlichkeit auf die menschliche Beeinflussung des Klimasystems zurückzuführen. Für uns Mods ist die Klimakrise eine der größten Herausforderungen der Menschheitsgeschichte und wir halten es für alles andere als gewiss, dass die Menschheit es schafft, dieser Herausforderung in angemessener Weise zu begegnen.

**Sachlichkeit und Respekt als Basis des Austauschs im Sub...**

Dieser riesigen Herausforderung wird man in einem Klimawandel-Sub aus unserer Sicht am ehesten dadurch gerecht, dass hier ein respektvoller und sachlicher Umgang herrschen sollte. Wer sich daran nicht hält, wird sanktioniert. Das gilt grundsätzlich für jede inhaltliche Äußerung.

**... auch anderen Meinungen gegenüber.**

Wir müssen anerkennen, dass es Menschen gibt, die den Klimawandel für weniger relevant halten. Oder die Fragen an die Klimawissenschaft haben. Wir finden es wichtig, dass auch mit diesen Menschen ein Austausch stattfinden kann. 

Für die Leugnung des anthropogenen Klimawandels ist dies grundsätzlich der falsche Sub, entsprechende Äußerungen werden regelmäßig gelöscht. Aber: Wer respektvoll und sachlich Fragen zu Details des Klimawandels oder der Klimawissenschaft hat, ist herzlich eingeladen, diese zu stellen. Und auch, wenn Ihr entsprechende Äußerungen für Quatsch haltet, bleibt bitte trotzdem sachlich und respektvoll, sonst müssen wir eingreifen.

**Dieser Sub wird ab sofort stark moderiert.**

Wir haben in der letzten Zeit schon mit stärkerem Durchgreifen begonnen und möchten unsere Linie hier jetzt öffentlich machen. Da das Thema häufig polarisiert, heizen sich die Diskussionen hier im Sub teils sehr auf, häufig sind Sachlichkeit und Respekt nicht mehr gegeben. Um dies künftig so weit wie möglich zu minimieren, werden wir künftig deutlich stärker durchgreifen.

Grundsätzlich folgen wir dabei folgendem Stufen-Ansatz:

* Vorstufe: Löschung von Beiträgen, die nicht den Regeln entsprechen
* Stufe: Temporäres Bannen von Nutzer und Nutzerinnen, die gegen Regeln verstoßen
* 2. Stufe: Permanentes Bannen Nutzer und Nutzerinnen, die gegen Regeln verstoßen

Wir behalten uns vor, Nutzer und Nutzerinnen, die in besonders krasser Weise gegen die Sub-Regeln verstoßen, sofort zu permabannen. Dazu gehört insbesondere platte Klimawandelleugnung, die auf kein Interesse an einem sachlichen Austausch schließen lässt. Wer nach einem Bann sachlich darlegen kann, dass der Verstoß gegen Regeln nur ein temporärer war, kann uns gerne per Modmail kontaktieren. 

**! Wir sind auf Eure Hinweise angewiesen !**

Wir können nicht alle Diskussionen hier im Sub mitlesen. Darum sind wir auf Eure Meldungen gegen Regelverstöße angewiesen.

**Moderatoren gesucht.**

Wer diesen Ansatz zur Moderation mittragen und uns bei der Moderation unterstützen möchte, kann uns gerne über Modmail Bescheid geben.",26,19,2023-07-20 08:58:54,de,Klimawandel

1. Reduzierter Energieverbrauch: Durch Sklavenarbeit wird der Einsatz von Maschinen und fossilen Brennstoffen minimiert. Sklaven übernehmen Aufgaben, die normalerweise von Maschinen ausgeführt werden, was den Energieverbrauch senkt.


2. Geringere Produktionskosten: Da Sklaven nicht entlohnt werden, sinken Produktionskosten, was dazu führt, dass Industrien weniger Anreiz haben, auf energieintensive Prozesse zu setzen, um Gewinne zu maximieren.


3. Kontrollierte Produktion und Konsum: Ein System, das auf unfreiwilliger Arbeit basiert, reduziert das Konsumverhalten drastisch. Da die Arbeiter keine Rechte hätten und nicht in der Lage wären, am Markt teilzunehmen, könnte der Produktionsüberschuss verringert und der Konsum insgesamt reduziert werden.

Außerdem sind Sklaven günstig und können in großer Zahl Maschinen ersetzten,ein anderer Vorteil ist es,dass man Sklaven z.B in Lybiem für unter 1000€ bekommen kann.

1fqhgpr,[PV] So viel Schwachfug im Umlauf.,"Bin seit kurzer Zeit (darum nicht repräsentativ) auch endlich Betreiber einer PV Anlage auf dem Dach.

Die letzten Tage war es permanent bewölkt und die Anlage hat dennoch unseren Tagesbedarf gedeckt, den Speicher voll gemacht und ins Netz eingespeist.


Wie oft muss man sich anhören, dass so eine Anlage ja im Herbst und Winter nichts produziert.

Wir brauchen echt eine Aufklärungskampagne.


PV braucht keine direkte Sonne, PV braucht Licht.


Ich warte auf einen sonnigen Tag, sollte denn dieses Jahr nochmal einer kommen und dann sehe ich, was sie insgesamt kann.
Aber die Performance bei diesem bedeckten Himmel ist schon geil.

Edit:
Zahlen Daten Fakten:

Installiere Leistung: 13,76kwp
Je zur Hälfte Nord-West und Süd-Ost.

Volle Leistung wird die also in seltenen Fällen erreichen aber darum ging es mir nicht.
Die sollte den ganzen Tag über Strom produzieren (außer nachts, klar).
Speicher 5kw.

In den Morgenstunden, wie auch jetzt akut macht sie ~1kw.
Das deckt schön den morgendlichen Verbrauch.
Wenn’s mehr sein soll, kommt es aus dem am Vortag gefüllten Speicher.

In der Spitze hatte sie jetzt immer so 3-5kw.
Das war selbst fürs mittägliche kochen genug. Wenn man parallel wasch- und Spülmaschine anschmeisst, hilft auch da der Speicher wieder. Und das sind ja nur kurze Zeiten.

Gegen Abend wurde es wieder weniger und ging auf 200w runter, bis etwa 20 Uhr.
Ab dann kam das Netz oder der Speicher zum Einsatz. 
Der Speicher hat aber bisher die ganze Nacht das Haus versorgt. Wir haben irgendeinen Verbraucher, der ab Mitternacht zyklisch Strom braucht. Vermutlich der Kühlschrank. Aber das ist auch egal.
Der Speicher ist morgens noch ~30% gefüllt und gönnt sich ab dann wieder die überschüssige Sonnenenergie.

1fhlho8,Römerweg unter Gletscher / Col de Zanfleuron Pass,"Hallo

Tl;Dr weiss man etwas über den freigewordenen Römerweg, bzw. hat jemand einen Artikel dazu?

Bin nicht sooo tief drin in der Materie. Bezüglich Klimawandel hab ich bisher halt einfach der Wissenschaft vertraut und dazu eigene Erfahrung mitbekommen (sehr selten Schnee im Winter im Ggs. zu früher bzw. teilweise sogar T-shirt Wetter (Mittelland Schweiz), Bilder von Gletscherrückgängen der letzten 100 Jahre, Diagramme und Bilder von den Polen etc).

Ich möchte auch weder den (zu schnellen) Wandel noch die Ursache in Frage stellen. Aber das Argument der Leugner mit der freigewordenen Römerstrasse lässt mir (bisschen übertrieben) keine Ruhe.

Da war also vor 2'000 Jahren irgendwo gletscherfrei, zwischendurch nicht mehr und jetzt wieder.
So ein einzelner Fakt würde ich nie als Gegenbeweis sehen, schon gar nicht für eine globale Veränderung und deren Auswirkungen. Auch weiss ich, dass die Erde über die Mia. Jahre Temperaturschwankungen hatte und dass der aktuelle Anstieg vor allem wegen des krassen Tempos ein Problem ist. Nun ist so eine Schwankung innerhalb 2'000 Jahre aber auch nicht allzu langsam, wenngleich nicht so schnell wie diese 150 Jahre seit der Industrialisierung.

Was ich halt gerne wissen würde, weiss man etwas darüber, warum es damals dort so eisfrei war? So ein Gletscher verändert sich ja auch nicht wegen ein paar warmen Jahren.

Bin auf einen Mimikama Artikel gestoßen, der dieses ""Argument gegen Klimawandelproblematik"" aufgreift, die Situation bestätigt und mitteilt, dass dies nicht als Argument zu sehen ist, schon gar nicht in Bezug auf die Komplexität der Thematik. Jedoch mir zu wenig liefert um es als Argument gegen dieses Argument zu sehen. 

Auch andere Artikel habe ich gesehen, welche die Sache aufgreifen und einer davon auch auf Mimikama verweist. 

""Ob der Pass während der letzten Zwischeneiszeit vor rund 6.000 Jahren tatsächlich eisfrei war, lässt sich ohne weitere Untersuchungen nicht mit Sicherheit sagen.""

Ähm, dass dort was gebaut wurde, ist doch ein ziemliches Indiz, dass da eisfrei war..? ^^^

Jedenfalls, Wall of Text, weiss man da nichts drüber, war es schlicht eine örtlich-zeitliche Anomalie / ein temperaturmässiger Ausreißer nach oben oder etwas?

Danke

Oder  ist das ""einzig"" Schlimme an solchen Bränden dass Unternehmen (ob öffentlich oder privat) nun Gewinne entgehen, weil nicht vorausschauend gewirtschaftet wurde?

1fb7uo7,"Für diejenigen, die Bücher lesen","Hey zusammen! 🌿📚

Ich dachte, einige von euch könnten die Buchtauschplattform, die mein Freund und ich erstellt haben, nützlich finden. Bei [Buchbaum](https://buchbaum.de/) können Nutzer\*innen ein neues Zuhause für ihre gelesenen Bücher finden, anstatt sie ungenutzt im Regal verstauben zu lassen – und gleichzeitig neue Bücher für sich selbst entdecken. Unser Ziel ist es, die Lebensdauer von Büchern zu verlängern und einen Beitrag zur Ressourcenschonung zu leisten.

Hier sind ein paar „interessante“ Fakten zur Buchindustrie:

* Laut dem Umweltinstitut München müssen für eine Million Exemplare eines 250-seitigen Buches mehr als **12.000 Bäume** gefällt werden.
* Der Druck und Verkauf von **zehn Büchern** verursacht **11 kg Kohlendioxid**, was dem Pro-Kopf-Fußabdruck eines Fluges von Frankfurt nach Berlin mit einer vollbesetzten 737 entspricht.
* Abholzung, Verarbeitung und Druck setzen **Kohlenmonoxide** und **Stickoxide** in die Atmosphäre frei – beides Treibhausgase, die Wärme in der Atmosphäre halten.
* Beim Bleichen von Papier mit Chlor entstehen **Dioxine**. Diese sind krebserregend und brauchen Jahrzehnte, um abgebaut zu werden.
* Rund **80 Prozent** der benötigten Fasern werden nach Deutschland importiert und stammen nicht aus Recyclingpapier.

ausnahmsweise möchte ich mal die Reichweite dieses Subs nutzen und einem kleinen Magazin etwas Gehör verschaffen. 

Seit 1993 hat die Redaktion des Greenpeace Magazin (GPM) sechsmal im Jahr hochwertige, kritische aber auch aktuelle Artikel zum Thema Umwelt, Mensch und Politik gedruckt. Mein Vater hat mir mein erstes Abo zum Abitur geschenkt und seit dem bin ich Leser. Ich habe die Hefte in der Familie verteilt mit Freunden geteilt und auch regelmäßig Abos zum Geburtstag verschenkt. Mir war es wichtig, dass sich mein Umfeld mit dem Thema Umwelt auseinander setzt. 

Anfang dieses Jahres dann die Enttäuschung. Das Greenpeace Magazin wird eingestellt. Zu wenig Leser.

Ein Kernteam der alten Redaktion möchte dennoch weiter machen. Mit ""atmo"" soll es einen Nachfolger geben, sodass der Umweltjournalismus nicht komplett aus der Auslage verschwindet. Dazu sind allerdings Abonnements nötig.

Meine Bitte: Schaut euch gerne das GPM an, schaut euch atmo an und wenn es euch gefällt, überlegt ob ihr es unterstützen wollt.

Vielen Dank!

1eudoqn,"Eine Antwort zu Doomerismus und der Position, man könne ja eh nichts mehr retten","Es gibt ja viele Stimmen, die sagen, dass eh nichts mehr zu retten sei. Nur als Beispiel mal /u/zogaboys59 in [diesem Kommentar](https://old.reddit.com/r/de/comments/1etpsht/die_viel_zu_warmen_meere_sind_unser_aller_problem/ligki8k/).

Was ich dazu meine:

/u/yogaboys69 : Nicht vergessen, dass es schon lange auch eine explizite PR Strategie der fossilen Industrie ist (unter anderen Strategien, wie [der gezielten Förderung der Rechten](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/15/shell-oil-project-2025-climate-crisis)), Doom-Stimmung zu verbreiten, und dass man nichts machen könne.

Dass wir nicht so weiter machen können wie gehabt, ist richtig. Wie aber die Zukunft aussieht, hängt ganz wesentlich von unserer kollektiven Antwort und kollektiven Prozessen ab. Und die sind gerade wenn es um grosse oder lang dauende Veränderungen geht, nicht vorhersagbar. Fünf Beispiele:

* [Perestroika](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika) und der Zerfall des Stalinismus und des sowjetischen Blocks um 1989. Das hätte noch 1984 niemand vorausgesehen und war die größte politische Veränderung der letzten 75 Jahre.
* Das [international kopierte Einspeisegesetz (EEG)](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz) und die folgende weltweite massive Förderung der Windenergie.
* Der [atemberaubende Preisverfall bei Solarmodulen](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth), das Erreichen von [Solar Grid Parity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_parity) und der dadurch ausgelöste weltweite absolute Boom bei carbonfreier Stromerzeugung
* die [massiven Fortschritte bei der Batterietechnik](https://www.golem.de/news/akkutechnik-catl-stellt-erste-natrium-ionen-akkus-fuer-autos-vor-2107-158529.html). Zusammen mit den beiden vorstehenden Faktoren führt der gerade zu einer rapiden und massiven Decarbonisierung der weltweiten Stromerzeugung.
* Der [rasante Umstieg von Grosstädten wie Amsterdam](https://www.wired.com/story/car-free-cities-opposition/), Kopenhagen, [Paris](https://english.elpais.com/lifestyle/2024-04-24/the-cycling-revolution-in-paris-continues-bicycle-use-now-exceeds-car-use.html#https://english.elpais.com/lifestyle/2024-04-24/the-cycling-revolution-in-paris-continues-bicycle-use-now-exceeds-car-use.html%23), Lyon, Barcelona, Brüssel weg vom Auto und zu Fahrrad und ÖPNV als Transportmittel.

Es gibt also bereits gewaltige Veränderungen - auch solche, welche die ökonomischen etablierten Verhältnisse auf den Kopf stellen, wie die fossile Stromerzeugung. Klar ist, da kommen spannende Zeiten auf uns zu - aber wir stehen eben nicht am Ende der Geschichte sondern in einer Krise, in der jede Handlung und jedes Wort doppelt zählt..",48,71,2024-08-17 05:27:05,de,Klimawandel

1eti6d8,"Eine Überlegung zum Thema ""Individuelle Massnahmen gegenüber kollektiven Massnahmen"" - Immanuel Kants ethischer Grundsatz der Aufklärung als Mittel zum kollektiven Wandel","Es gibt ja immer das Argument, dass individueller Verzicht auf CO2-emittierende Aktivitäten (wie z.B. Fleisch zu essen, zu fliegen, oder im Winter auf schnuckelige 23 Grad zu heizen) angeblich ""nichts bringe"" und dass dies ja doch eine böse Kampagne von Big Oil wäre, die nur alle (unwidersprochen notwendigen) kollektiven Anpassungen auf Einzelne abwälzt. Was man gleich dagegen einwenden kann, dass Big Oil natürlich weder individuelle noch kollektive Veränderungen mag, denn beides bedeutet weniger Profite.

Ich habe hier eine Analogie zu bieten, die das Verständnis der Situation vielleicht erhellt. Ein Gedankenexperiment mit einer Parallel-BRD:

Angenommen, wir wären eine Bundesrepublik mit moderner Technik und so weiter, wie in Wirklichkeit. Aber, und im Unterschied, wir würden immer noch, wie bis zum 18. Jahrhundert, Abwässer aus dem Nachttopf und Spülbecken ungeklärt aus dem Fenster kippen. Natürlich würde das furchbar stinken. (Ja, das tat es.) Und deswegen gäbe es regelmässig Cholera-Pandemien mit vielen Toten (die es ja [im 19. Jahrhundert auch real gab, mit verheerenden Folgen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera#Cholera-Pandemien)). Ein paar kluge Wissenschaftler und Hygiene-Forscher würden herausfinden, dass das an ansteckenden Bakterien liegt, die durch verdrecktes Trinkwasser übertragen werden, und würden konsequente Abwasserentsorgung vorschlagen.

Und nun gäbe es eine breite gesellschaftliche Diskussion und einen (wenn auch von strikten Pißtopf-Befürwortern und Wissenschaftsleugnern - unsere Parallel-BRD wäre ja auch pluralistisch - angefochtenen) generellen Konsens ""Hm, Abwasser aus dem Fenster kippen ist ja eigentlich nicht so gut, und sollte eigentlich abgeschafft und durch eine vernünftige Kanalisation ersetzt werden"". Also eine kollektive Aufgabe. Aber die Politik käme irgendwie nicht so recht in die Pötte (vielleicht aufgrund der Parteispenden der Pißtopf-Industrie, oder von Wohnungsgesellschaften welche die Mehrausgabe scheuen).

Jeder kann sich denken, was die Querdenker und Nuerechten der Parallel-Bundesrepublik dazu meinen täten, aber das interessiert mich gar nicht. Nicht einen Furz.

Die Frage, die ich aufwerfen möchte, lautet vielmehr:

Ist es in Anbetracht der **kollektiven** Aufgabe sinnvoll, als **individuellen** Schritt **selber auf die unhygienische Abwasserentsorgung zu verzichten**? Auch wenn dies allein das **kollektive** Problem nicht löst? Und die Kosten beim Einzelnen liegen?

Ein großer Philosoph der Aufklärung, nämlich Kant, hatte eine Position dazu. Er gab dieser [einen sehr sperrigen Namen, nänlich ""kategorischer Imperativ""](https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorischer_Imperativ), aber der Gedanke ist einfach. Um ihn in meinen Worten zu beschreiben:

**""Verhalte dich stets so, dass es wünschenswert wäre, dass die Grundsätze deines Verhaltens allgemeines Gesetz würden.""**

Das ist nur etwas komplexer als ""Was Du nicht willst, was man dir tu, das füg auch keinem anderm zu"", das Grundschulkinder lernen.

Es klingt banal, aber ich denke dieses Prinzip ist viel tiefer als es aussieht, denn aufgeklärte (und nur deswegen freie), moderne Gesellschaften beruhen in ihrer Existenz grundlegend auf:

1. Vernünftiger, rationaler Einsicht
2. Kooperation.

Nun kann man argumentieren, das mit dem Abwasser sei doch Pippifax (ha!), und würde doch nicht vergleichbar sein mit der Bequemlichkeit und den ökonmischen Vorteilen der fossilen Energieträger. Wenn so argumentiert wird, kann man gerne etwas anderes nehmen, was vergleichbare Eigenschaften hat, und aus guten Gründen abgeschafft wurde, wie etwa die Sklaverei in Nordamerika. Allerdings ist das mit dem Abwasser ein guter Vergleich zum CO2 Problem, denn das Problem nicht zu lösen hat sehr gravierende, lebensverändernde Folgen für uns alle. (Auf der anderen Seite zeigt das Beispiel der Sklaverei einen anderen Aspekt besser auf, den der Ungerechtigkeit, denn ein Vielfaches der Ressourcen der meisten Erdenbewohner zu verbrauchen, auf Kosten derer Lebensgrundlagen ist nicht nur strohdumm sondern auch massiv ungerecht, und aus meiner Sicht wegen der massiven Folgen für Eigentum, Wohlergehen und Gesundheit eine Form von Gewalt.)

Es wird selbstverständlich immer Leute geben, die das Festhalten an solchen ""Traditionen"" befürworten, weil es ihnen persönliche Vorteile bringt. Aber ist dies, gemessen an Kants Grundsatz haltbar? Denn man darf ja nicht vergessen, dass auch wenn das bessere Verhalten des Einzelnen das kollektive Problem nicht löst, ja trotzdem der **Schaden**, den er Einzelne mit seinem Verhalten verursacht, ganz real ist.",3,24,2024-08-16 02:56:14,de,Klimawandel

1erzcbh,Pyrolyse für carbon capture,"Ich bin heute über einen Artikel, dass eine carbon capture anlage in Betrieb genommen wurde, die 3000t CO2 pro Jahr speichern soll, was nicht gerade viel ist, wenn man bedenkt, dass 3 Tonnen CO2 nur eine Tonne Kohlenstoff ist.  
Dabei ist mir wieder der Gedanke gekommen, warum man nicht einfach Biomasse zu Kohle verarbeitet und die speichert. Nach ein paar Minuten Recherche bin ich ich auf den Carbon Twister gestoßen.  
[https://www.carbon-twister.com/technologie-und-produkte/f-500-pro](https://www.carbon-twister.com/technologie-und-produkte/f-500-pro)

Das ist ein recht primitives System. Für Pyrolyse braucht man laut Gemini 300°-800° C, was man mit konzentrierter Solarenergie auch hinbekommt. Stichwort dafür ist Solar Thermal Pyrolysis wofür man auch Ansätze findet zur Biodieselerzeugung.

Das mag vielleicht nicht die effizienteste oder wirtschaftlichste Lösung sein, aber sie ist einfach. Und wenn man überschüssiges Biomaterial, wie Grünschnitt teilweise verheizt zur Verkohlung bleibt unterm Strich immernoch ein negativer CO2 Ausstoß für die Atmosphäre übrig.

Mit Isolierung und Wärmerückgewinnung lässt sich das sicher auch noch effizienter gestalten.

1es8kvl,Mit dem Uralt-Bus VW T1 quer durch Europa,"Ich bin ein total liberaler Typ und mache Mitbürgern keine Vorschriften. Klimaschutz geht zuerst bei mir selbst los. Ich rufe nicht nach Staat, ermahne nicht meine Mitmenschen, sondern frage zuerst: was kann ich fürs Klima tun?

Bei der sog. WDR BusTour 2024 fährt Herr Dassel für den WDR mit einem 47 Jahre alten VW T1 Bus monatelang quer durch Europa. Würde er das privat machen, würde ich mir niemals irgendeinen Kommentar anmaßen. Aber Klima schrotten für den WDR, mit Beitragsgeldern, geht's noch?

[Christian Dassel vor dem VW T1 Bus für die WDR BusTour 2024](https://preview.redd.it/hi6a329k5oid1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee92410f8e512f8df108072613cda533f6541015)

Die WDR BusTour, eine kuriose Mischung aus Steimle's Welt und mareTV, hätte qualitativ sicherlich keinerlei Auswirkung gehabt, wenn man auf den modernen VW ID Buzz mit Ökostrom gewechselt wäre. Vielleicht hätte das sogar den ein oder anderen Technikbegeisterten angezogen.

So bleibt der WDR wie er ist: ewiggestriger Klimasünder. Wäre ja fast komisch, wenn daran nicht die Welt zugrunde gehen würde und wir das auch noch mit unserem Rundfunkbeitrag subventionieren müssten.",0,19,2024-08-14 14:08:02,de,Klimawandel
1er5epq,Bücher und Dokus zum Klimawandel in einfacherer Sprache,"Ich lese gerade mal wieder ein Buch zum Thema Klimawandel (Unlearn CO2, kann es bisher empfehlen). Was mir bei den bisher gelesenen Büchern zu dem Thema auffällt, ist dass sie sich an ein Publikum mit höherem Bildungsgrad richten. Sie sind ja auch oft von Wissenschaftlern geschrieben und entsprechend gehalten. 

Jetzt will ich aber mal meinen Eltern was zu dem Thema empfehlen. Beide sind Migranten mit ganz guten Deutschkenntnissen für den Alltag und ihre Jobs, haben in ihrem Heimatland einen Volksschulabschluss und eine Art schulische Ausbildung gemacht. Denen wären Bücher wie Das Klimabuch oder Unlearn CO2 einerseits zu hoch. Andererseits werden in den genannten Büchern auch das Thema Klimakrise mit Themen wie Feminismus, Ableism, Minderheiten etc gemischt. Da gibt es wenig Berührungspunkte und evtl auch Desinteresse zu den Themen. Glaube auch dass es auf einige Menschen eher abstoßend wirken kann. 

Deshalb die Frage ob jemand Bücher oder auch Dokumentationen kennt die einen guten Überblick über das Problem zeigen und sich nicht allzuviel mit ""Nebenkriegsschauplätzen"" (so wichtig die Themen auch sind!) beschäftigt. Dazu noch in etwas einfacherer Sprache. Bin über jeden Tip dankbar. 


Disclaimer, Bevor mir vorgeworfen wird, ich würde Themen wie Feminismus nicht ernst nehmen: Das tue ich absolut. Ich denke nur, wenn wir jeden erstmal zum Feministen machen müssen, bevor wir ihn zur Klimabewegung bekommen, können wir es auch gleich sein lassen. Der Klimawandel (bzw die Klima und Biodiversitätskrise) ist für die nächsten Jahre bzw Jahrzehnten unser Problem Nummer 1 und das mit weitem Abstand. ",11,2,2024-08-13 07:28:17,de,Klimawandel

Aber wohin fließt das Geld im Malle-Flug? Zu Ryan Air, und die kaufen bei Exxon Kerosin und bei Boeing Flugzeuge.

Bis so vor 1-2 Jahren ist mir klar geworden ist, dass wir zwar gegen den Klimawandel etwas tun können aber solange nicht alle Länder mitmachen das Ganze doch relativ aussichtslos wird. Jeder kann seinen Teil beitragen (so viel er kann), dass wir die Folgen abfedern können. Aufhalten werden wir diesen nicht mehr. Wir müssen viel mehr versuchen mit den Folgen zu leben bzw. Maßnahmen ergreifen den Klimawandel ""erträglicher"" zu machen. Das geht vor allem durch technischen Fortschritt, z.B. Küstenschutz und Wohlstand, der es den Leuten ermöglicht besser mit den Folgen umzugehen oder gar nicht erst Opfer zu werden. Die Todeszahlen nach Naturkatastrophen sinken übrigens seit Jahren, vor allem bedingt durch bessere Versorgung, Wohlstand, etc. (Quelle und Buchempfehlung: Factfullness von Hans Rosling)
Ein weiterer Punkt ist, dass die Bevölkerung keineswegs mehr ewig wachsen wird. Wahrscheinlich erreichen wir gerade so die 9 Milliarde in den 50er Jahren dieses Jahrhunderts. Danach geht's bergab. China alleine wird 600 Mio. Menschen verlieren bis 2100. Ich bin inzwischen der Meinung, dass die Welt sich selbst wieder ins Gleichgewicht bringt. Wir werden durch den technischen Fortschritt Möglichkeiten entwickeln den Klimawandel abzufedern. In der Vergangenheit der Menschheit wurde jede Herausforderung über einen Prozess wieder ins Gleichgewicht gebracht. Uns wird es nichts bringen den Kopf in den Sand zu stecken und in Selbstmitleid zu verfallen, weil das Bringt uns überhaupt nichts.

Die Produktion und der Konsum von Fleisch sind ja nach aktuellen Statistiken recht intensiv was CO2-Emissionen angeht und tragen somit signifikant zur Klimaerwärmung bei. Aber woraus resultiert das genau?

Die Tiere geben doch beim Konsum nur soviel CO2 frei, wie sie auch vorher über das Futter aufgenommen haben. Und anschließend wird das CO2 wieder von den Futterpflanzen aufgenommen. Es bleibt theoretisch ein eigener kleiner Kreislauf.

Weiteres CO2 wird doch hauptsächlich über die Verwendung der Maschinen mit fossiler Energie zugeführt. Auch die Umwandlung beispielsweise in Methan wäre noch als zusätzlicher Faktor zu nennen.

Würde man also Strom/Landmaschinen mit regenerativen Energien betreiben, dann wäre doch die Fleischproduktion fast klimaneutral, oder? Ich kanns mir irgendwie nicht wirklich vorstellen. Wo ist bitte mein Denkfehler dabei?",6,47,2024-06-25 03:42:38,de,Klimawandel

1dlps9w,"Von wem, wo und warum werden Klimaschutz Maßnahmen behindert?","Die Antworten sind sehr komplex und können verschiedene Perspektiven berücksichtigen. Es gibt jedoch einige allgemeine Gründe, die von verschiedenen Akteuren genannt werden:

1. **Wirtschaftliche Interessen -** Wirtschaftliche Interessen - Einige Unternehmen, insbesondere in Branchen, die stark von fossilen Brennstoffen abhängig sind, könnten Klimaschutzmaßnahmen als Bedrohung für ihre Gewinne betrachten. Die Umstellung auf nachhaltigere Praktiken erfordert möglicherweise Investitionen und Veränderungen, die sich kurzfristig als kostenintensiv darstellen.
2. **Politische Parteien bzw. Interessen** - In einigen Fällen könnten politische Entscheidungsträger, die von Industrieunterstützung abhängig sind, zögern, Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, die bestimmte Wirtschaftssektoren belasten könnten. Es gibt auch politische Ideologien, die den Umweltschutz als eine geringere Priorität betrachten. Unterschiedliche politische Parteien können unterschiedliche Prioritäten und Meinungen in Bezug auf Klimapolitik haben, und es kann zu politischen Auseinandersetzungen über den besten Weg kommen.
3. **Nationalstaaten/Internationale Ebene** - Einige Länder könnten zögern, Klimaschutzmaßnahmen zu ergreifen, aus Sorge, dass dies zu einem wirtschaftlichen Nachteil im internationalen Wettbewerb führen könnte, wenn andere Länder keine vergleichbaren Maßnahmen ergreifen. Oder aufgrund mangelnder internationaler Verpflichtungen oder politischer Ideologien.
4. **Industrie und Unternehmen** - In einigen Branchen, insbesondere solchen, die stark von fossilen Brennstoffen abhängig sind, könnten Unternehmen versuchen, strenge Umweltauflagen zu blockieren oder zu verzögern, um ihre kurzfristigen Gewinne zu schützen.
5. **Automobilindustrie** - Die Umstellung auf emissionsfreie Fahrzeuge erfordert erhebliche Investitionen von Autoherstellern. Diese könnten sich gegen strenge Umweltauflagen wehren, um ihre Wettbewerbsfähigkeit zu erhalten.
6. **Landwirtschaft** - Landwirtschaftliche Interessen können Bedenken hinsichtlich möglicher Regulierungen und Änderungen in den landwirtschaftlichen Praktiken haben.
7. **Angst vor wirtschaftlichem Wettbewerbsnachteil** - Einige Länder oder Unternehmen könnten zögern, Klimaschutzmaßnahmen zu ergreifen, aus Angst, dass dies zu einem wirtschaftlichen Nachteil im internationalen Wettbewerb führen könnte, wenn andere Länder keine vergleichbaren Maßnahmen ergreifen.
8. **Mangelnde Aufklärung oder Verständnis** - Einige Menschen verstehen möglicherweise nicht vollständig die Dringlichkeit des Klimawandels oder leugnen ihn sogar aufgrund von mangelndem Wissen, falschen Informationen oder ideologischen Überzeugungen.
9. **Kurzfristige Denkweise** - Einige Entscheidungsträger könnten sich auf kurzfristige Ziele konzentrieren und Maßnahmen zum Klimaschutz vernachlässigen, die langfristige Vorteile bringen.
10. **Lokale Ebene** - In einigen Fällen könnten lokale Interessen, wie zum Beispiel in Regionen mit starker Abhängigkeit von fossilen Brennstoffen, gegen Klimaschutzmaßnahmen sein, um wirtschaftliche Veränderungen bzw. Nachteile zu verhindern.
11. **Bürgerinitiativen** - Einige Bürger könnten sich gegen bestimmte Klimaschutzmaßnahmen aussprechen, wenn sie deren Auswirkungen auf ihre Lebensqualität oder wirtschaftliche Situation fürchten.
12. **Falsche Informationen und Lobbyarbeit** - Einflussreiche Lobbygruppen könnten falsche Informationen verbreiten, um die öffentliche Meinung gegen Klimaschutzmaßnahmen zu beeinflussen.
13. **Mangelnde Priorität** - In einigen Fällen könnten Entscheidungsträger den Klimawandel als eine geringere Priorität betrachten und daher nicht die notwendigen Maßnahmen ergreifen.
14. **Gezielte Falschmeldungen** durch gewisse Akteure, um die Polarisierung in der Gesellschaft voranzutreiben und nötige Gesetze zu erschweren, allgemein mit dem Ziel die Demokratie zu schwächen. (Danke @ [Automatic-Cat-5348](https://www.reddit.com/user/Automatic-Cat-5348/)).

Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass dies allgemeine Faktoren sind, und es gibt sicherlich Unterschiede in den Gründen und Motivationen auf individueller, institutioneller oder nationaler Ebene. Der Klimawandel und seine Bekämpfung sind komplexe Herausforderungen, die verschiedene Sektoren der Gesellschaft betreffen, und die Hindernisse für wirksame Maßnahmen können sehr vielfältig sein.

1diksb7,Verständnisfrage ,"Hallo, 

Auf der Internetseite Climateactiontracker.org wird die wahrscheinliche Erwärmung bis Ende des Jahrhunderts mit 2,7 Grad Celsius angegeben. 

Der aktuell beste Schätzwert für die Klimasensitivität ist laut letztem IPCC Bericht 3 Grad Celsius.

Die CO2 Konzentration liegt momentan bei 423 ppm. Also noch recht weit entfernt von einer Verdopplung der CO2 Konzentration. Betrachtet man die CO2 Äquivalent Konzentrationen liegen diese aber bereits bei über 520ppm, also nicht mehr weit von einer Verdoppelung entfernt.

Die Frage: Bezieht sich die Klimasensitivität ausschließlich auf die CO2 Konzentration und nicht auf das Äquivalent? Und wenn nicht, wie kommt der Climateactiontracker dann ""nur"" auf 2,7 Grad Celsius Erwärmung? Dass die CO2 Äquivalent Konzentration auf über 560 ppm steigen wird, ist ja vermutlich mehr als gesetzt.

1di267k,Klimawandel – kann die Menschheit noch reagieren?,"Deutsche Klimatagung 12.03.-14.03.2024 auf dem Telegrafenberg in Potsdam.

**Das Jahr 2023 war das bisher heißeste Jahr seit Beginn der Wetteraufzeichnungen. Änderungen im Wettergeschehen sind markant, weitreichend und treten immer häufiger auf. Anpassungsmaßnahmen und Klimaservices stehen nun im Fokus.**

Neue Erkenntnisse aus der Forschung zum Klimawandel vertiefen unser Wissen beispielsweise zur veränderten Dynamik von Tiefdruckgebieten über dem Nordatlantik, zu den Starkniederschlägen mit verheerenden regionalen Auswirkungen oder zu den sich verstärkenden Hitzewellen, die eine ernsthafte Gefahr für die die Gesundheit der Menschen darstellen. Dieses Wissen ermöglicht verbesserte Wettervorhersagen und genauere Modellierungen des Klimas der Zukunft als Grundlage für notwendige Maßnahmen zur Klimaanpassung.

Frank Böttcher, Vorsitzender der Deutschen Meteorologischen Gesellschaft:

>""Der Staatengemeinschaft ist es in den letzten 30 Jahren nicht gelungen, die Treibhausgaskonzentrationen zu senken oder auch nur den Anstieg zu stoppen. Wir sind jetzt in eine Phase eingetreten, in der das Klimasystem sich mit sehr viel mehr Dynamik verändert als bisher. Die Überschreitung der 1.5°C Grenze aus dem Pariser Abkommen ist in wenigen Jahren zu erwarten. Das erste Drittel dieser Erwärmung erfolgte in etwa 80 Jahren, das zweite Drittel in etwa 23 Jahren; für das letzte Drittel erwarten wir eine Zeitspanne von nur 12 Jahren. Vor diesem Hintergrund müssen wir uns in den nächsten Jahrzehnten, auf ganz erhebliche Veränderungen des Klimasystems einstellen.""

**100 führende Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftler beraten sich vom 12. bis 14. März auf der DKT 13 (der Deutschen Klimatagung) in Potsdam, auf dem Telegrafenberg, zu diesen dringenden und nahezu alle Bereiche des menschlichen Lebens betreffenden Zukunftsfragen.**

**Sturmtiefs können in Europa erhebliche Schäden verursachen – Modellsimulationen zeigen eine künftige Ausweitung der Starkwindzonen.**

Es ist wichtig zu verstehen, wie die Klimaerwärmung unsere Tiefdruckgebiete beeinflussen wird. Nach Modellsimulationen wird sich die Intensität von Tiefdruckgebieten in der Zukunft wahrscheinlich nicht stark ändern. Jedoch könnten sich die von starken Winden betroffenen Regionen vergrößern – und damit auch deren Schadenspotenzial. Die dieser Tendenz zugrunde liegenden physikalischen Prozesse werden aktuell untersucht.

**Rekordwarmer Nordatlantik – Grund zur Sorge? Ursachensuche.**

2023 war das heißeste Jahr seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen. Welches sind die Ursachen für die Rekordtemperaturen der Meeresoberflächen und der bodennahen Atmosphäre und inwieweit gibt der außergewöhnlich warme Nordatlantik Anlass zur Sorge? Hat der Ausbruch eines Vulkans damit etwas zu tun oder haben die niedrigeren Aerosolemissionen der globalen Handelsschifffahrt einen Einfluss? Welchen Beitrag leisten großräumige Ereignisse wie El Niño? Diese Fragen werden in mehreren Beiträgen diskutiert.

**Hitzewellen der letzten Jahrzehnte hatten weltweit enorme gesundheitliche und finanzielle Auswirkungen – wird die Zukunft alles noch übertreffen?**

Die Hitzewellen der letzten Jahrzehnte hatten erhebliche Auswirkungen auf die Gesellschaft. Müssen wir erwarten, dass zukünftige Hitzewellen das Bisherige noch weit übertreffen? Gemeinsam mit anderen Organisationen entwickelt der Deutsche Wetterdienst die Grundlagen für notwendige Maßnahmen zur Abmilderung der Folgen von zukünftigen Hitze- und Kältewellen sowie Starkregenereignissen.

**Im Zuge des Klimawandels muss Deutschland auch in Zukunft mit verheerenden Starkregenereignissen rechnen.**

Bundesweit einheitliche Gefahrenkarten sind in Arbeit und werden der gesamten Bevölkerung frei zur Verfügung stehen. Dazu werden mit hochaufgelösten Simulationen mögliche Überflutungsszenarien erstellt. Dadurch kann das Risikopotential besser eingeschätzt werden und Planung und Durchführung von Schutzmaßnahmen können unterstützt werden.

**Wiedervernässung von Mooren als Kohlenstoffsenken.**

Ein Langzeitversuch in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern quantifiziert die Zeiträume, innerhalb derer durch die Wiedervernässung von Mooren regionale klimatische Änderungen bewirkt werden können und untersucht, welchen Einfluss Extremereignisse, wie beispielsweise der Trockensommer 2018, haben.

**KI in der Klimaforschung.**

Das Potential von Methoden der künstlichen Intelligenz für die Klimaforschung wird in diversen Beiträgen aufgezeigt. Ein Beispiel ist die Vorhersage des El Niño-Phänomens, welches mit den Temperaturrekorden ab dem Sommer 2023 in Verbindung gebracht wird.

**Hochaufgelöste Klimavorhersagen auf unterschiedlichen Zeitskalen als Basis für zukunftsweisende Entscheidungen.**

Der Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) veröffentlicht Vorhersagen für die nächsten Wochen, Monate und Jahre. Für die Erstellung qualitätsgeprüfter und räumlich hoch aufgelöster Datensätze werden Nutzer aus unterschiedlichen Sektoren eingebunden, um eine höchstmögliche Verständlichkeit und Anwendbarkeit für die Beratung in Klimafragen für Politik, Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft zu erzielen.

**Ist das normal oder schon der Klimawandel?**

Seitdem der Klimawandel in den öffentlichen Diskurs Einzug gehalten hat, wird im Zusammenhang mit Extremwetterereignissen in Deutschland und der Welt immer wieder dieselbe Frage gestellt. In den letzten zehn Jahren entwickelten Wissenschaftler daher Methoden, um die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels auf einzelne Extremwetterereignisse zu quantifizieren. Ergebnisse dieser Analysen werden in mehreren Beiträgen auf der DKT diskutiert.

**Zu der Tagung eingeladen** hat die Deutsche Meteorologische Gesellschaft (DMG), unterstützt durch das Deutsche Geoforschungszentrum (GFZ), das Alfred-Wegener-Institut Helmholz-Zentrum für Polar- und Meeresforschung (AWI), das Potsdam-Institut für Klimafolgenforschung (PIK), die Freie Universität Berlin und den Deutschen Wetterdienst (DWD).

**Öffentliche Podiumsdiskussion am 12.03.2024 um 20 Uhr, Wissenschaftsetage Potsdam.** Im Rahmen der 13. Deutschen Klimatagung findet am Dienstag, den 12.3.2024 um 20 Uhr in der Wissenschaftsetage Potsdam eine öffentliche Podiumsdiskussion statt. Zum Thema “Ein Planet, verschiedene Wahrnehmungen: Klimakrise und Kommunikation” diskutieren Stefan Rahmstorf (Potsdam-Institut für Klimafolgenforschung), Sophie Haebel (Klimarat Potsdam), Katharina von Bronswijk (Psychologische Psychotherapeutin), Max Bürck-Gemassmer (Allianz Klimawandel und Gesundheit) und Kirsten Lange (Netzwerk Klimajournalismus). Es moderiert Gunther Tiersch vom Fachausschuss Klimakommunikation der Deutschen Meteorologischen Gesellschaft.

1dffg15,Was ist schlimm an dem Klimawandel?,"Hey, lasst uns bitte eine respektvolle diskusion haben ich will niemanden ärgern sondern habe wirklich ein paar fragen zu dem Klimawandel die mich dazu bringen skeptisch zu sein, darüber das er anthropogen ist.

Helft mir bitte eure denkweise zu verstehen und erklärt mmir ein paar Sachen die ich vielleicht falsch verstanden habe damit ich helfen kann die Menschheit zu retten.

Also meine erste Frage wäre bezüglich den Auswirkungen des Klimawandels auf die menschliche Species und ihr fortbestehen, wie wird der Klimawandel uns beeinflüssen oder schaden?

Laut NASA ist die Erde seit dem Klimawandel grüner geworden, da der höhere CO2 Gehalt in der Luft und die höhere Tempratur das Pflanzenwachstum unterstützen.  
[https://www.nasa.gov/technology/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth-study-finds/](https://www.nasa.gov/technology/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth-study-finds/)

Die meisten Waldbrende sind brandstiftung und nicht komplett Klima bedingt.  
[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-shows-84-wildfires-caused-humans-180962315/](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-shows-84-wildfires-caused-humans-180962315/)  
aber nartürlich erkenne ich an dass der Klimawandel die Brände extremer macht, trotzdem muss man beachten das nur die nartürlichen Brände wenig Schaden anrichten und die Erde ingesamt grüner wird trotz 84% der Waldbrände die durch Menschen erzeugt wurden.

Das die Wüsten teils größer werden, ist auch unwichtig da die Erde insgesamt grüner wird.

Bitte beachtet auch das unsere aktuellen Modelle des Klimas die Wirkung von Wolken (Sonneinstrahlung) und den Meere garnicht darstellen können daher kann man nicht zu 100% sagen dass der Klimawandel komplett durch Menschen verursacht wurde.  
Im Vergleich zum bisherigen Klimawandel der Erde ist das garnichts.

Dann gibt es das Artensterben, aber das ist normal und gab es schon immer. (egal ob der jetzige Klimawandel anthropogen ist oder nicht). Arten passen sich an oder sterben aus so ist die Evolution nun mal.

Das einzige sehr schlimme an dem aktuellen Klimawandel sind die Steigung des Meeresspiegel und die extremeren Wetterereignisse, aber ich bezweifle das wenn wir jetzt komplett aufhören mit dem CO2 wir noch viel retten werden und wir müssten viele Menschen sterben lassen um mit dem CO2 aufzuhören aktuell.

Ich weiß das es viel zu diskutieren gibt aber ich kann nicht übersehen das in den Medien nur die eine Seite gezeigt wird, es gibt viele Wissenschaftler die nicht an den anthropogenen Klimanwadel zu 100% glauben, aber ihrer Sichtweise wird kein Gehör geschenkt.  
Mann kann ja wenigstens die Fakten nennen und dann erklären wo der Denkfehler ist stattdessen wird man wie ein Irer behandelt.

1cxsqst,Umgang mit Klimaleugnern,"Liebe Leute, 

Ich bin Handwerker, Schornsteinfeger und Energieberater, überprüfe bei der regulären Arbeit Heizungsanlage und berate meistens währenddessen die verunsicherten Kunden, was den das Sinnigste für ihr Haus sei, sollte die Heizung mal den Geist aufgeben. 

Meistens lauter meine Antwort ""Wärmepumpe"". 

Nun zur Situation:
Gestern hatte ich eine Kundin mit einem relativ modernen Haus (bj 2000) sie fragte mich ebenfalls, was denn mmn das beste wäre und ich meinte halt, dass Gas in de heutigen Zeit bei ihrem Haus überhaupt keinen Sinn mehr machen würde, dass der Gesetzgeber ganz klar weg von Fossilien Brennstoffen will und das im Bezug auf Umwelt, Klima und Zukunft unabdingbar ist, davon weg zu kommen.

Sie begegnete mir mit:

""Ach Sie sind so einer?"" 
Erklärte mir groß, dass es solche Wetter Veränderungen immer gab und das das alles Gehirnwäsche sei, ihr Heizungsmonteur würde auch nichts von Wärmepumpen halten und sie würde sich auch wieder eine neue Gasheizung einbauen lassen, sie würde auch auf keinen Fall so eine ratternde Kiste ans Haus stellen. 

Ich meine, seit 1994 ist nachgewiesen, dass der Klimawandel Menschgemacht ist und dafür gibt es wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse... 



Aber wie begegnet man so jemandem? 
Ich habe wenig Lust dem Kunden immer nur zu sagen was er hören will und ja und amen ist hier der falsche Weg.

Habt ihr Vorschläge oder Ideen?


Edit:
Erstmal vielen Dank für die vielen Anregungen, Tipps und Antworten.

Als Berater habe ich die Tätigkeit die Leute zu beraten, sie aufzuklären was ihre Optionen sind und das unabhängig. Bei einer Beratung tue ich das auch, jedoch bei diesen Vorfall war es ein ganz normales Gespräch mit der Kundin während meiner Tätigkeit als Schornsteinfeger, wie es immer wieder vorkommt und nicht als Berater(ich bin mir sicher Sie weiß nichts von meiner Tätigkeit als Energieberater und das will ich auch nicht jedem unter die Nase reiben).

Edit:
""Ich meine, seit 1994 ist nachgewiesen, dass der Klimawandel Menschgemacht ist und dafür gibt es wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse... ""
War keine Aussage von mir gegenüber dem Kunde!

Und ich habe ihr keinen Vortrag gehalten, sondern wir haben uns lediglich darüber unterhalten was für eine Heiztechnik mMn in ihrem Haus am sinnigsten sei, sollte ihre Anlage mal getauscht werden müssen. In einem Nebensatz erwähnte ich dann, dass wir früher oder später sowieso von den fossilen Brennstoffen weg müssen, darauf kam dann ihr Spruch der mich zum grünen gemacht hat 😃

1cxe5ym,Vorbildliches Hotel aus Erlangen,"Ich möchte mal wieder eines dieser Vorbilder mit euch teilen, die finde ich wichtig sind als Beispiele wenn mal wieder jemand sagt „X geht nicht weil Y“

Das Hotel Luise aus Erlangen ist seit 2015 „klimapositiv“ also sie kompensieren mehr CO₂ als sie nach scope 3 Berechnung emittieren. Das an sich ist erstmal nichts besonderes mehr (und auch generell mit Vorsicht zu genießen, wie sicher die meisten von euch inzwischen (wie ich auch*) gelernt haben – *man wünschte ich dass das nicht so shade ist, wie es geworden ist. 

Was das Hotel für mich besonders macht ist die Konsequenz in der sie nachhaltige Maßnahmen umsetzen. 

- sie haben mehrere „nachwachsende Hotelzimmer“, also Hotelzimmer die voll cradle to cradle zertifiziert sind (das finde ich richtig krass) 
- Tische aus alten Kühlschränken
- Tassen aus Kaffeesatz 
- einen Baum Auf dem Dach als Symbol dass die Natur an oberster Stelle steht
- in jedem Zimmer liegt eine Ausgabe von „Kleine Gase – große Wirkung“
- zero waste Frühstück (auch krass finde ich für ein Hotel)
- kfw 45 Standard 
- pv usw ist eh klar

Und das sind nur einige Beispiele von ihren über 230 Maßnahmen. 

Wie gesagt mir ist wichtig das zu teilen, weil es zeigt dass sowas geht. Außerdem finde ich gibt es mut und nötigen Optimismus in einer Zeit in der es so leicht ist zynisch und handlungsfähig zu werden.

Ich bin gespannt was ihr dazu sagt. ",14,5,2024-05-21 13:56:38,de,Klimawandel

> Alleine in 2023 wurden mehr Erneuerbare Energien zugebaut, als die Atomenergie in 70 Jahren insgesamt erreicht hat.

> Erneuerbare Energien sind heute schon in vielen Fällen die billigste Energie.

> Forschende sprachen bereits im vergangenen Jahr von einem „unumkehrbaren Wendepunkt“ durch die fallenden Kosten der Solarenergie, die diese bis 2050 zur wichtigsten Energiequelle der Welt werden lassen.

> Insgesamt sieben Länder weltweit versorgen sich laut einer aktuellen Übersicht bereits heute 100 Prozent mit erneuerbarer Energie

> Nach dem Absturz der Solarpanelpreise in China gibt es derzeit einen Preisabsturz von Akkus.

> Mitte 2024 sollen Batteriespeicher nur noch halb so viel kosten wie noch Anfang 2023. 2025 soll der Preis dann nochmals kräftig runtergehen.

> Der Preisverfall bei Stromspeichern führt dazu, dass weltweit 68 zunächst geplante Gaskraftwerke nun nicht mehr gebaut werden.

> Batteriespeicher werden in den nächsten Jahren die Energieversorgung in Deutschland umkrempeln und die Kosten der Energiewende senken.

> Gerade geht der Trend außerdem zu LFP-Batterien, die ohne kritische Rohstoffe auskommen und zu kobaltarmen NMC-Typen.

Nach vielem Hin und Her haben wir eine ""tolle"" Metapher für unseren Umgang mit dem Klimawandel gefunden:

Wir behandeln den Klimawandel so, wie wir auch öffentliche Toiletten (bzw. in Restaurants etc) behandeln.   
**Jede/r** regt sich darüber auf, dass der Dreck des Vorbenutzenden nicht weggemacht wurde und machen es einfach oft selbst nicht.

  
Mit dieser Metapher habe ich tatsächlich angefangen mein Verhalten in sehr vielen Gebieten angepasst. Müll ist kein ""Müll"" sondern eben Gegenstände, die meiner Verantwortung obliegen. Sie müssen recycled, upcycled oä werden. Entsteht tatsächlich Müll, habe ich den schlechtesten Weg gefunden. Sehe ich Müll in Öffis oä. räume ich ihn weg. Mein Ziel ist es mittlerweile, in den Räumen und Gebieten durch die ich mich bewege, einen kleinen positiven Unterschied zu machen. Beim bikepacking sammle ich Müll ein. Ich fahre 100% mit Öffi & Rad. Das Rad und die Anbauteile sind gebraucht gekauft. Etc. Klamotten kaufe ich nur noch gebraucht. Ich versuche ""No-Buy"" zu leben: Nur ersetzen und reparieren. Wenn gekauft wird, wird gebraucht gekauft. (Nein, klappt leider nicht immer)

Ich versuche halt einfach, meinen Dreck und einen Teil des Vorbenutztenden wegzumachen.

Anyways. Ich wollte die Metapher einfach teilen.

1cn79td,"Untragbare Kosten für Versicherungen und Staat durch Bau in deutschen Flutgebieten. (Berlin.Table, 6. Mai 2024)","# Der Streit um Schäden, die nicht mehr zu bezahlen sind

**Extremwettereignisse und Schadensdimensionen nehmen dramatisch zu. Nun rächt sich: Das Bauen in Flutgebieten ist bis heute Alltag. Politik und Verwaltungen haben viel zu viel zugelassen. Nun will niemand mehr die Kosten übernehmen.**

Es war eine unscheinbare Abstimmung bei der letzten Bundesratssitzung vor Ostern. Tagesordnungspunkt 11, keine Aussprache, keine Gegenstimmen, und ruckzuck war das Zweite Gesetz zur Änderung des DWD-Gesetzes abgehakt. Nun darf sich der Deutsche Wetterdienst in Offenbach an die Arbeit machen und ein Naturgefahrenkataster erstellen. Ein Portal, transparent, kostenfrei und für jeden einsehbar, in dem jeder und jede sein persönliches Risiko bemessen kann, nach einem Stark- oder Dauerregen den Keller geflutet zu bekommen oder von jähen Hagelschlägen ereilt zu werden. 

Bislang war dem Wetterdienst ein solches kostenloses Kataster – wegen privater Konkurrenz – nicht gestattet. Aber es ist überfällig, darin sind sich alle einig. Und einig ist sich die Fachwelt auch, dass die Zahl der Extremwetterereignisse mit nachfolgenden Milliardenschäden höchstwahrscheinlich zunehmen wird. Dann ist es aber auch schon vorbei mit dem Konsens. Vor allem, ob es eine Pflichtversicherung gegen Naturgefahren geben soll, ist umstritten. Seit Jahren währt inzwischen der Streit. Denn nur rund die Hälfte der Gebäude in Deutschland ist gegen Elementarschäden versichert, in einer Reihe von Bundesländern ist es sogar nur ein Drittel. 

Ja, eine Pflichtversicherung muss her, sagen die 16 Ministerpräsidenten der Länder. Ja, befand zuletzt auch die SPD-Bundestagsfraktion. Nein, sagt der FDP-Bundesjustizminister und sperrt sich bisher hartnäckig dagegen. Nein, sagt auch der Gesamtverband der Versicherer (GDV), der ständig höhere Schadensummen begleichen muss. 

Die Versicherer warnen schon lange

Die Assekuranzen sind quasi die Frühsensoren für die Elementargefahren. Schon vor 30 Jahren warnten Rückversicherer wie die Münchner Rück oder Swiss Re eindringlich vor dem Klimawandel und der damit verbundenen mutmaßlichen Schadenshäufung. Die Mahner sollten Recht behalten. Dass die Temperaturen in Mitteleuropa schneller steigen als anderswo auf der Welt, kommt erschwerend hinzu.

Die Versicherer kalkulierten bisher in etwa so, dass sie ein 200-jähriges Großschadensereignis noch begleichen können. Nur, ein Ereignis wie im Ahrtal findet längst nicht mehr alle 200 Jahre statt, sondern viel häufiger. Rund 40 Milliarden an materiellen Schäden hinterließ die Flut, die sich im Juli 2021 durchs Ahrtal wälzte. „Nochmal ein solches Ereignis, dann explodieren die Prämien“, heißt es bei den Assekuranzen unter der Hand. Und noch ein bisschen gedämpfter: „Wir kriegen es nicht mehr gestemmt.“

Im Klartext: In Deutschland ist angekommen, was sich für Experten längst abgezeichnet hat. Der Klimawandel führt zu Extremwetterereignissen, die selbst in einem Land wie Deutschland nicht mehr bezahlbar sind. Nicht für die Versicherer und auch nicht für die öffentliche Hand. Es sei denn, unter der Einforderung von Prämien, die der gemeine Eigenheimbesitzer nicht mehr bezahlen kann und will. So schieben sich Versicherer und politische Entscheider nun gegenseitig den schwarzen Peter zu.

Es hat sich eine Kultur der Sorglosigkeit eingeschlichen

Doch die Versäumnisse sind gemacht – und sie sind nicht den Versicherern anzulasten. Vielmehr hat sich eine Kultur der Sorglosigkeit eingeschlichen. Und der freiwilligen Kostenübernahme durch die öffentliche Hand. Immer schon waren insbesondere die Städte durch Naturgefahren bedroht. Etwa durch Brände. Die Folge waren strengere Bauvorschriften, Fluchtwege, Sprinkleranlagen, Rauchmelder. Heute haben diese Ereignisse keine Konsequenzen mehr. Jedenfalls nicht diejenigen Ereignisse, die mit Starkregen und Überschwemmungen zu tun haben. „Die Vorschriften entsprechen nicht mehr den Gegebenheiten“, klagen Versicherungsfachleute.

Über 320.000 Gebäude in Deutschland stehen in amtlich ausgewiesenen Überschwemmungsgebieten. Und jährlich kommen immer noch weitere hinzu. Über 30.000 Gebäude in den vergangenen zehn Jahren, wie unlängst der Präsident des Gesamtversicherungsverbandes (GDV), Norbert Rollinger, beklagte. Denn auch heute noch gibt es Baugenehmigungen en masse für Bauplätze auf flutbedrohten Flächen. Weil Gemeinden so großzügig wie leichtfertig Bauflächen ausweisen, auch in Flutgebieten, weil das Baurecht zahllose Ausnahmen kennt – und weil Landes- und Bundesregierungen im Schadensfall Betroffenen leichtfertig Entschädigungen zusagen. Inzwischen wird der Ton schriller. „Wir sollen das Problem lösen, das die Länder verbockt haben“, klagt ein Versicherungsexperte.  

Überhaupt die Länder. Im vergangenen Jahr verhinderten sie im Klimaanpassungsgesetz ein sogenanntes Verschlechterungsverbot. Der Vorschlag des Bundes hatte vorgesehen, „die Vulnerabilität von Grundstücken und Bauwerken sowie der betroffenen Gebiete insgesamt gegenüber den negativen Folgen des Klimawandels nur insoweit erhöhen, als dies unvermeidlich ist“. Es wäre eine deutliche Beschränkung von Bauten auf Überschwemmungsflächen gewesen. In der veröffentlichten Fassung des Gesetzes ist der Passus komplett gestrichen. Auch im sonst so akkurat administrierten Bayern werden immer noch Höfe auf Polderflächen errichtet. 

„Ihr könnt doch nicht das Ahrtal entvölkern“

Wie man es nicht machen sollte, ist im Ahrtal zu besichtigen. Dort fließen staatliche Zahlungen nur, wenn die Gebäude an gleicher Stelle wieder errichtet werden – gerne auf Überschwemmungsflächen. Eine Verwaltungsvorschrift vom Oktober 2021, erlassen zweieinhalb Monate nach der Flut, legt fest, dass es staatliche Hilfen nur gibt, wenn genau wie vor der Flut wieder aufgebaut wird, im gleichen Umfang, an gleicher Stelle. Zusätzliche Schutzmaßnahmen sind nicht eingeplant und werden auch nicht bezuschusst.

Seit der Flut wurde so bis auf zwei Dutzend Gebäude in den betroffenen Orten alles wieder so errichtet, wie es einmal stand. Schlimmer noch, auch neue Gebäude sind auf den gefluteten Flächen entstanden. Wie etwa gegenüber der Don-Bosco-Schule an der St. Pius-Brücke in Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler. Das gesamte Schulzentrum, seinerzeit schwer verwüstet, ist bis heute nicht nutzbar. Direkt gegenüber am anderen Ufer der Ahr steht auf gleicher Höhe inzwischen ein schmucker Neubau – zynisch formuliert, bereit für die nächste Flut und mit einiger Sicherheit zum Verdruss der Versicherer.

Und die nächste Flut wird kommen. Denn vergleichbare Wassermengen hatten schon im Jahr 1910 das Tal geflutet und ähnliche Verwüstungen wie vor drei Jahren hinterlassen. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit ist also hoch, dass 2021 nicht das letzte Mal war. Als Vertreter der Assekuranzen auf den mutmaßlichen Unsinn der Nach- und Neubauten hinwiesen, bekamen sie von den Ämtern und aus der Landeshauptstadt zu hören: „Ihr könnt doch nicht das Tal entvölkern.“

Der generelle Vorwurf der Versicherer: „Die Landesregierungen sind nicht in der Lage, den Wählern die Wahrheit zu sagen.“ Und man muss wohl anfügen: Sie wollen es häufig auch nicht. Die Versicherer ihrerseits sind nicht mehr in der Lage, die Schäden zu stemmen. Auch eine Pflichtversicherung, so argumentieren sie, werde nicht funktionieren.

Katastrophen auf Wiedervorlage

Stattdessen fordern sie Korrekturen in den Bauordnungen. „Unseren Bauvorschriften sind Klimawandel und Extremwetterereignisse weitgehend fremd“, sagt etwa Oliver Hauner, Leiter Sach- und Technische Versicherungen beim GDV. Vordringlich sollte dort ein Schutzziel verankert werden. Ohne ein ausformuliertes Schutzziel bleibe das klimaangepasste Planen und Bauen ein frommer Wunsch. Die These der Versicherer: „Das erzeugt Katastrophen auf Wiedervorlage.“ Eine weitere Forderung: Für jedes neue Bauvorhaben sei vorab und verpflichtend eine Gefährungsbeurteilung für Extremwetterereignisse vorzulegen.

Die Versicherer haben längst reagiert. Um ihr Risiko einigermaßen bemessen zu können, haben sie sich ein Zonierungssystem für Überschwemmungsschäden zugelegt, ZÜRS genannt. 22 Millionen Adressen in Deutschland sind dort, unterteilt in vier Gefährdungsklassen, erfasst. Auch für Starkregen und potenzielle nachfolgende Schäden wurde inzwischen ein (dreistufiges) System eingerichtet. Es hilft den Versicherern bei der Frage, welches Gebäude in welchem Ausmaß hochwassergefährdet ist und wie die Prämien zu kalkulieren sind. 

Und so blieben die Versicherer auch entspannt, als im vergangenen Dezember Niedersachsen und Teile von Sachsen-Anhalt großflächig unter Wasser standen. Überrascht waren sie nicht. Es waren durchweg Flächen, die in ZÜRS als Zone 3 oder 4 kategorisiert waren, also Riskogebiete. Das System ist so präzise, dass auch Kommunen gerne auf die Daten zurückgreifen würden. 

Andere sind längst weiter. In Österreich gibt es ein solches Portal, das im Netz und für jedermann zugänglich in 3-D-Animationen Gefahrenzonen für Flüsse, Wildbäche, mögliche Lawinen, Erdbeben, aber auch Stürme, Hagel und schwere Schneefälle ausweist. Präzise, differenziert nach Wassermengen und Windstärken – und gebäudegenau. Die Bewohner wissen, wo sie bei Starkregen die Sandsäcke aufschichten müssen, welche Straßen noch befahrbar sind und wo Schutzmauern errichtet werden müssen. Versicherer, Kommunen, Wetterdienste, Ministerien – alle haben ihr Wissen eingespeist. Auch die Schweiz hat längst ein solches Portal, sauber differenziert unter anderem für Starkregen. Lawinen, Waldbrände, Erdbeben oder auch Stürme. Nebenbei haben die ersten Kantone bereits mit Umsiedlungen begonnen, weil das Wohnen an manchen Alpenhängen als zu risikobehaftet gilt.. 

Auch für Deutschland liegen die Daten vor; aber bisher nicht aggregiert, nicht interpretiert, aufbereitet und auf einem Portal abrufbar. Das soll nun, legitimiert durch das neue Gesetze, in Hochgeschwindigkeit und bis zum Jahresende der Deutsche Wetterdienst erstellen. Die Daten seien vorhanden, sagt Sprecher Uwe Kirsche. Allein, „sie sind verstreut übers Land“. Auch er sagt zum Ahrtal: „Es ist ziemlicher Unsinn, dort wieder aufzubauen, wo die Häuser gerade weggespült worden sind.“ Denn die Zahl der Wetterextreme und ihre Intensität würden zunehmen. Kirsches Fazit: „Es gibt einfach Gebiete, da sollte man nicht wohnen.“

Letztlich müssen Landesregierungen, Landräte und Kommunalverwaltungen den Wildwuchs stoppen. „Die Politik muss jetzt die Weichen stellen und aktiv Klimafolgenanpassung betreiben"", sagt Anja Käfer-Rohrbach, stellvertretende GDV-Hauptgeschäftsführerin. Doch die politischen Entscheider zögern. Die einen, weil sie immer noch Bebauungsgebiete ausweisen wollen, die anderen, weil sie die Kosten und ein Risikokataster fürchten. Der Grund: Für Siedlungsflächen, die amtlich als flutgefährdet ausgewiesen sind, verlieren die darauf stehenden Immobilien augenblicklich dramatisch an Wert. Für die Hauseigentümer, für Immobilienfonds, für die Kommunen. Es gibt keine Gewinner, nur Verlierer – und ganz viel schlechte Stimmung. 

Auch die SPD-Bundestagsfraktion will – anders als die Versicherer – eine Pflichtversicherung für Immobilienbesitzer. Aber auch Johannes Fechner, SPD-MdB und einer der Autoren des SPD-Papiers, bekennt: „In Sachen Prävention müssen wir viel härter durchgreifen.“ Und ja, dazu bedürfe es „politischer Härte“.

Ich denke nicht, dass wir nur ansatzweise noch etwas gegen den Klimawandel unternehmen können und das Jahr 2023 und das bisherige Jahr 2024 haben es mehr als deutlich gemacht. 

Es sind mehrere Faktoren, die Zeigen wie verzwickt die Lage eigentlich ist:

 Erstens sollten wir jetzt eigentlich in eine La Nina Phase wechseln, jedoch liegen Temperaturen trotzdem noch über der 2016er El Nino Phase und noch über der 2023er El Nino Phase. Auch beachten sollte man, dass der Effekt von CO² in der Atmosphäre erst zeitverzögert zur Wirkung kommt und wir in den letzten Jahren unseren CO² nur noch erhöht haben. Auch haben wir 2023 das erste mal durchschnittlich 1,5°C erreicht, was wir eigentlich um alles verhindern wollten und das bis 2100, **77** Jahre früher als erwartet.

Des weiteren haben wir einige Kippunkte identifiziert und sind auch kurz davor einige zu überschreiten. Die Atlantische Umwälzströmung (AMOC) ist so schwach wie lange nicht mehr; wir haben erst letztens festgestellt, dass Grönland 20% mehr Eis verliert, als wir dachten; die jetzige Korallenbleiche ist die schlimmste die von uns beobachtet wurde, was die Zerstörung eines kompletten Ökosystems bedeutet; der Permafrost gibt mehr CO² ab, als er aufnimmt und das sind nur einige Faktoren.

Die Ozeane stehen im allgemeinen kein bisschen besser da und die aktuelle Entwicklung ist sogar fast noch erschreckender. Ozeantemperaturen sind auf einem Rekordhoch, was u.a. dazu führt, dass Fische teilweise in Richtung der Pole wandern, um der Hitze zu entkommen. Hierzu kommt, dass die Mehrheit aller Fischarten bereits jetzt überfischt sind, 97% der in der Bonner Konvention festgehaltenen wandernden Fischarten sind kurz vor dem Aussterben (sowie 1/5 aller dort gelisteten Arten), während 10% aller Meereslebewesen bereits jetzt schon kurz vor dem Aussterben sind, eine Zahl die auf 90% steigen könnte sollten wir unsere Emissionen nicht reduzieren.

Klar könnte man jetzt noch unzählige andere Umweltprobleme, als auch gesellschaftliche Probleme aufzählen, die durch all das ausgelöst werden bzw. schon in vollem Gange sind, aber das würde den Rahmen sprengen und eigentlich sollte das auch reichen. Wenn man jetzt bedenkt, dass keines dieser Probleme nur ansatzweise Anklang findet und es auch keine internationale Zusammenarbeit gibt, um diese globalen Probleme zu lösen und auch keine Bemühungen stattfinden CO² Emissionen **weltweit** zu reduzieren, kann man sich eigentlich selbst ausmalen, zu was das führen wird.

1c8hddl,Mehr CO2 in der Marsatmosphäre und dennoch weniger Treibhauseffekt?,"Liebe Lesende,
kürzlich kam die Frage auf, wieso auf dem Mars ein geringerer Treibhauseffekt als auf der Erde herrscht, obwohl es eine bedeutemd größere CO2-Konzentration gibt. Nun ja, die Antwort ist nicht ganz einfach, aber vorweg: beim Treibhauseffekt geht es nicht einfach um die Konzentration eines Gases in einem bestimmten Raum.

Die Atmosphäre des Mars ist sehr dünn, woraus folgt, dass CO2 zwar Infrarot-Strahlung in thermische Energie umwandeln kann, aber nicht genug zum Erhitzen da ist. Schauen wir uns einige Hintergrundinformationen zum Treibhauseffekt an: wenn ein Planet keine Atmosphäre hat, können wir die Temperatur seiner Oberfläche leicht berechnen, basierend auf der Energiemenge, die die Sonne produziert, der Entfernung des Planeten von der Sonne und der Lichtmenge, die der Planet reflektiert. Das bezeichnen wir in der Meteorologie als Effektivtemperatur.

Um herauszufinden, wie hoch die Temperatur eines Planeten mit Atmosphäre ist, müssen wir darüber nachdenken, wie viel Sonnenstrahlung durch die Atmosphäre absorbiert wird und wie viel Strahlung, die von der Planetenoberfläche ausgeht, von der Atmosphäre absorbiert wird, bevor sie dort ankommt. Der Treibhauseffekt entsteht, wenn ein Teil der von der Oberfläche eines Planeten nach oben abgestrahlten Energie absorbiert und in Wärme umgewandelt wird, bevor er in den Weltraum gelangt.

Die Sonne strahlt Licht mit vielen Frequenzen aus, aber die meiste Energie liegt im sichtbaren Teil des Spektrums, den wir mit unseren Augen sehen können. Auf der Erde wird UV-Strahlung vom Ozon in der Stratosphäre absorbiert, was die mittlere Atmosphäre erwärmt, aber die Erdatmosphäre ist für sichtbares Licht fast vollständig transparent. Der Boden absorbiert jedoch einen Teil dieses Lichts, erwärmt sich und strahlt Energie in Wellenlängen ab, die auf der Oberflächentemperatur basieren, wobei es sich bei terrestrischen Temperaturen hauptsächlich um Infrarotstrahlung handelt.

Die Mathematik dahinter ist kompliziert, aber die Quintessenz ist: Strahlung, die von der Sonne kommt oder von dem Planeten aufsteigt, wird absorbiert und die Atmosphäre erwärmt.

Die Marsoberfläche ist (im Vergleich zur Erde) aus folgenden Faktoren kalt:

1. Die Marsatmosphäre ist besonders: es gibt nicht viel von ihr. Die Luftdichte auf der Erde beträgt ungefähr 1,23 kg/m³. Die Luftdichte des Mars beträgt hochgerechnet 0,015 kg/m³ → weniger als 1,5 % des Durchschnitts der Erde. Zwischen der Marsoberfläche und dem Weltraum gibt es also bedeutend weniger Atmosphäre als zwischen Erdoberfläche und Weltraum. Folgerichtig können wir also sagen, dass es durch die geringe Luftdichte sehr unwahrscheinlich ist, dass ein Photon auf seinem Weg durch die Atmosphäre absorbiert wird.

2. Der Mars ist weiter von der Sonne entfernt als die Erde. Der Mars umkreist die Sonne in einer mehr als 1,5-fachen Entfernung wie die Erde und erhält daher nur etwa 43 % der Energie der Erde (586 W/m² für den Mars gegenüber 1361 W/m² für die Erde).",33,33,2024-04-20 00:39:29,de,Klimawandel

1c59wlp,Ich kann meine Position nicht untermauern und brauche Hilfe,"Hallo Community,


gestern haben ein paar Freunde über den Klimawandel diskutiert und ich war unfähig, meine Position richtig dar zu stellen.... Ich habe meine Meinung von reddit, habe aber gemerkt, dass ich sie nicht richtig mit Fakten unterstützen konnte, sondern da eher auf Gefühl laufe. Ich möchte hier mal die Position meiner Freunde darstellen

1. Klimawandel ist ein globales Problem. Was bringt es uns als einzige Nation den Klimawandel anzugehen? Sowas muss international gelöst werden, es ist ja auch ein globales Problem, also braucht es eine globale Lösung. 


2. Warum soll Deutschland den Held spielen und versuchen, den Klimawandel vor allen anderen mit zu lösen, wenn uns die Auswirkungen nicht so stark treffen werden?


3. Es hat keinerlei finanzielle Vor- aber alle Nachteile, wenn wir unsere Wirtschaft teuer anpassen, ohne jetzt einen Gegenwert zu haben. Denn die anderen Länder passen ihre Wirtschaft nicht an und wir werden zurück gelassen, weil wir unsere Wirtschaft mit Investition in Klimamaßnahmen zerstören. 


Sie meinten auch, sie ""stehen ja ethisch hinter dir, aber finanziell ist das halt nichts"" und nachdem ich gefragt wurde ""warum soll denn grade Deutschland in Klimawandelmaßnahmen investieren?"" konnte ich nichts mehr sagen. 


Meine Position ist, daß Klimawandelmaßnahmen sich rechnen werden (aber wie und warum?) und das wir schnellstmöglich was tun müssen, das Klimawandel nicht teuer sein muss und es viele Lösungen gibt. Das Argument, das wir Menschenleben retten, wird nicht gezählt, da es ethisch ist.

Mein Kumpel meinte dann, wenn ich so sehr hinter Wissenschaft und Fakten bin und es ja angeblich so leicht und auch billig sein kann, den Klimawandel zu stoppen, warum macht es dann niemand? Das kann ja nur sein, weil es so nunmal so teuer und unpopulär ist. 


Kann mir jemand helfen, Quellen zu suchen, die meine Meinung stützen? Viel zu lange hab ich nur gelesen und gesagt Jo muss stimmen und jetzt hatte ich nichts zu sagen... Mein Kumpel meinte noch, wenn die Argumente so auf der Hand liegen, müsste ich das doch auch einfach so können ohne darüber nach zu denken und das hat mich komplett raus gebracht, weil ich eigentlich auch so denke. 


Vielen Dank an alle die das hier gelesen haben und ich hoffe, ich bekomme ein paar Antworten und Quellen :D ich habe google bereits bemüht aber finde nicht wirklich was zu diesen spezifsichen Fragen.",52,293,2024-04-16 03:13:10,de,Klimawandel

in meiner Stadt sind Pläne vorgestellt und abgenommen worden, um ein naheliegendes Biotop in ein ""Wohnquartier"" umzuwandeln. Ich verstehe, dass wir Wohnraum brauchen, allerdings gibt es da mit Sicherheit auf den Tausenden qm² jahrzehntelangem Leerstand bessere Möglichkeiten. 

Ich möchte nun also versuchen dieses Biotop zu erhalten. Wie denkt ihr kann man idealerweise vorgehen? Gibt es so etwas wie verpflichtende Umwelteinflußstudien bei so etwas? Kann man unser Umweltamt zwingen, entsprechende Informationen zu besorgen? Habt ihr andere Ideen um dieses Unternehmen ein bisschen schwieriger zu gestalten?

1ay0tuc,Wie umgehen mit der Situation im Angesicht des Offensichtlichen?," Wie geht ihr mit momentaner Situation um? Damit meine ich nicht der Klimawandel als Situation. Sondern, dass man das mit dem Klimawandel ja weiss, aber halt einfach so darüber weg sieht. 

Ich alterniere zwischen Hoffnungslosigkeit mit viel Ärger über die Verantwortlichen und stoischer Gleichgültigkeit. Mich versuchen an den kleinen Dingen die ich beeinflussen kann zu erfreuen.

Hoffnungslos weil wir Lösungen brauchen, die auch sehr viele unangenehme Änderungen mit sich bringen. Einen Pfeil aus der Wunde zu ziehen schmerzt. Aber irgendwann muss er raus. Unsere Politik wirft uns aber ein paar Schmerzmittel hin. Keiner will die unangenehme Wahrheit überbringen oder sogar handeln. Somit verrecken wir langsam, aber wenigstens angenehm unter Schmerzmittel - bis dann irgendwann noch offensichtlicher wird, dass man wohl besser schon früher was gemacht hätte.

Hoffnungslos weil immer wieder auf Eigenverantwortungsbasis der ""Bürger"" gepocht wird. Überraschung - Eigenverantwortung klappt nicht. Wir fressen ungesunden Scheiss, trinken massiv zu viel Alkohol, rauchen und schaffen es nicht mal 2x pro Woche 30min zum Sport. (natürlich nicht alle, aber das Problem ist ja genau auf Gesamtgesellschaftlicher Stufe) - Konsequenzen, die wir tragen. Und zwar alleine. Das ist den meisten klar. Wir alleine sind benachteiligt durch diesen Lebensstil. Trotzdem schaffen wir es nicht, uns zu ändern. Und dann sollen wir es schaffen, zu Gunsten von der Allgemeinheit etwas zu ändern?

Die Leute, die am meisten etwas ändern müssen sind leider aber gerade die, die davon profitieren wenn alles so bleibt. Zumindest kurzfristig.

Wie geht man damit um? Wie geht ihr damit um?",18,54,2024-02-23 08:46:28,de,Klimawandel

Beim AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) meint man primär das Phänomen von warmen Klima das nach Nordeuropa gelangt, es ist aber eigentlich ein Kreislauf/Meeresströmung, die sich durch alle Weltmeere über den Globus bewegt.

Bei El Nino (oder El Niño–Southern Oscillation, ENSO)  finde ich nur Dinge, wie Südostasien und Südamerika einander beeinflussen, aber das müsste doch auch eine Verkettung einmal um den Globus sein?   
Ich denk da noch an diese Dynamik zwischen Australien und Südafrika, wenns bei den einen brennt, gibts bei den anderen Flut usw., die man IOD (Indian Ocean Dipole) nennt. 

Nach meinem groben Verständnis (tut mir Leid wegen etwaiger Kopfschmerzen) müsste doch ENSO und IOD eine Sache sein die einander bedingt und wahrscheinlich auch eine Sache mit dem AMOC? So eine Schleife, mit der kalten und warmen Strömung in den Meeren und entsprechend Hoch- und Tiefdruck-Gebieten und Luftströmungen? 

Wenn das eine Sache wäre, hat die einen Namen? Oder ist das so grob zusammengefasst, dass es einfach Weltklima ist? haha

In meiner Vorstellung müsste doch eine Änderung in einem dieser Systeme sich auf alle anderen auswirken. Alles was ich aber so im Alltag an Nachrichten oder in Youtube-Dokus wahrnehme, sind die genannten Systeme im Einzelnen. Liegt also nahe, dass das getrennte Dinge sind und ich eine falsche Vorstellung habe okay, aber eventuell ist es ja doch eine große Sache.

1aqp212,Welche Einschränkungen braucht es?,"Moin zusammen,

Ich habe kaum Ahnung zum Thema Klimawandel. Ich weiß er ist da und wird schlimmer. So weit, so basic. Ich kann mich nicht in jedes Fachgebiet auf hohes Niveau einlesen.
Jetzt bin ich in letzter Zeit, im Rahmen der Artikel von Prof. Dr. Stefan Rahmstorf, auf das Kippen des Golfstroms hingewiesen worden. Ich habe von Wissenschaftlichen Papieren zwar nur die Hälfte verstanden, aber die Dramatik ist klargeworden. Genauso wie die Aussage, die sinnvollerweise an jeden Ende eines Artikels zum Klimawandel steht ""Die Menschen müssen sich einschränken um den Klimawandel zu stoppen!""

Die Frage, die ich mir dann immer stelle ist:"" Wo und Wie muss ich mich einschränken? Also Konkret!"" Ich höre, Fleischkonsum einschränken! Ich Frage mich um wieviel? Ganz oder ist einmal im Monat Ok. Es ist klar Autos sind schädlich! Ich frage mich, wie viel darf ich noch fahren? Darf ich überhaupt fahren?

Das zieht sich so durch. Ich würde mich gerne mehr für die Rettung des Klimas einsetzten, verstehe aber nicht so ganz, welche Veränderungen genau das für mich bedeuten wenn es heißt ""Die Menscheit muss sich massiv einschränken!""

Daher jetzt die Frage an euch: Was bedeutet das alles konkret für mich? Kein Fleisch? Kein Auto? Welche Jobs und Industrien würde es noch geben? Darf man Reisen oder ist das Exotischste der Nachbarort? Ist das Ehrenamt, wofür man ein Auto braucht noch Unsetzbar oder nicht mehr drin? Wird die Wende im Klimawandel für mich überhaupt bezahlbar sein? Oder sitze ich dann auf der Straße, weil ich mir die gestiegenen Preise als (aktuell) Unterer Mittelstand nicht mehr leisten kann?

In meiner Studienzeit habe ich mich viel mit Brennstoffzellen beschäftigt und frage mich, warum die Brennstoffzelle nicht mehr im Gespräch ist, wenn es um Umweltschutz geht.  
Es wird dumm gesagt Wasserstoff zu Strom ""gemacht"". Mit den ganzen Windparks im Norden, könnte man bei Netzauslastung Wasserstoff erzeugen und diesen dann für Fahrzeuge, Heizung etc verwenden. Das würde auch den grössten Nachteil bei E-Autos, das Lange stationäre Laden an der Säule lösen, wenn man an der Tankstelle den Tank mit Wasserstoff volltanken kann. Der Trend geht aber komplett zu ""normalen"" E-Autos mit riesigen Batterien. Ist wahrscheinlich wieder das Henne Ei Problem mit den Tankstellen und die Tatsache, dass die Herstellung von Sauerstoff mehr Energie (Strom) benötigt als am Ende wieder nach der Umwandlung in der Brennstoffzelle wieder herauskommt. Wenn ich aber sehe dass in der Nordsee Windkraftanlagen still stehen, weil das Netz gerade ausgelastet ist, frage ich mich schon ob das nicht ein Weg wäre ""kostengünstig"" Wasserstoff zu machen und zu Nutzen. Wasserstoff kann auch in das Gasnetz eingespeist werden, jedoch kommt es dann beim Endgerät zu Problemen, da diese dann auf einen Veränderten Brennwert eingestellt werden müssen.  


Wenn jemand mehr Einblick hat, kann er mich gerne Aufklären oder Verbessern.",0,68,2024-01-22 02:58:03,de,Klimawandel

Mit viel Geld beeinflussen ein paar Konzerne die Weltpolitik dahingehend. 

Da kam mir der Gedanke, dass das sehr ähnlich zu einigen Verschwörungsmythen ist. Da gehts ja oft auch darum, dass es eine kleine, reiche und böse Elite gibt, die die Welt steuert. 

Jetzt würde ich nicht soweit gehen, dass die fossile Industrie die Welt steuert. Aber dass sie einen großen Einfluss haben, konnte man zuletzt ja auf der COP beobachten. Zudem wurden bekanntlich einige Kriege und Konflikte wegen fossiler Energie geführt. 

Daher frage ich mich, wieso das nicht bei Verschwörungsgläubigen so rezipiert wird. Da ist es ja eher das Gegenteil. Man behauptet ja eher eine Linksgrüne Elite (wo auch immer die sein soll, man merkt davon bekanntlich wenig) wollte die Welt mit Energiewende und Co irgendwie schlechter machen.

Dennoch erschließt sich mir nicht wirklich der Sinn davon, für den Klimawandel nur Superreiche verantwortlich zu machen. Klar, Superreiche emitieren pro Person 1000x mehr CO2 als der Durchschnitt. Nur leider interessiert das Klima ja nicht, wer wieviel emittiert, sondern nur, wieviel insgesamt in die Atmosphäre gelangt. Und wenn jetzt [das reichste 1 Prozent alleine für 15 Prozent, die ärmere Hälfte der Menschheit nur für 7 Prozent](https://www.oxfam.de/ueber-uns/aktuelles/klimawandel-ungleichheit-reichste-1-prozent-schaedigt-klima-doppelt-so-stark) der Emissionen verantwortlich ist, dann ist das natürlich wahnsinnig unfair. Doch selbst ohne die Reichen müssten wir immernoch irgendwie die übrigen 85% loswerden!

Es ist schon sinnvoll, auf diese Unterschiede aufmerksam zu machen, nur sehe ich eine Tendenz, zu sagen ""so lange die Reichen viel mehr emitieren als ich, bringt das alles ja nichts."". Nur so lange alle anderen gar nichts verändern, würde selbst das komplette Wegfallen aller Reichen den Klimawandel nicht stoppen. Ich sehe da kein ""Entweder-Oder"", sondern beides muss verändert werden - vor Allem der Konsum der Reichen, aber letztendlich auch der von allen anderen - ausgenommen natürlich die, die wirklich kaum Geld und damit auch kaum Emissionen haben.",0,85,2023-12-30 12:39:00,de,Klimawandel

Ich hab den mal mit deepl übersetzt:

&#x200B;

**Was bedeutet eigentlich ""Umsetzung"" und warum ist sie so wichtig?**

&#x200B;

Meine Kollegin Nina Lakhani, die derzeit in Dubai weilt, hat sich mit der kritischen Frage der Umsetzung befasst, die zu einem echten Knackpunkt in den Gesprächen geworden ist.

Sie erklärt:

Wenn es eine Sache gibt, in der sich die Entwicklungsländer in Cop28 einig sind, dann ist es die Forderung an die Industrieländer, ihre rechtsverbindlichen Verpflichtungen aus dem Pariser Abkommen einzuhalten und den Entwicklungsländern die Mittel zur Umsetzung zur Verfügung zu stellen. Dies war das zentrale Thema, das am Montagabend als Reaktion auf den Textentwurf der globalen Bestandsaufnahme immer wieder angesprochen wurde.

Barbara Creecy, die Umweltministerin Südafrikas, sprach über die Erfahrungen ihres Landes bei der Umsetzung einer gerechten Energiewende: ""Wir haben heute weniger als 10 % der Unterstützung erhalten, die wir bis 2030 für den Umsetzungsplan benötigen. Für viele Entwicklungsländer, insbesondere auf dem afrikanischen Kontinent, liegt die Lücke nicht im Ehrgeiz, sondern in der Frage der Mittel zur Umsetzung.

Die brasilianische Delegierte fügte hinzu: ""Es ist sehr schwierig, etwas ohne die notwendigen Mittel zu tun. Lassen Sie uns zuerst über die Mittel sprechen. Und auf der Grundlage dieser Mittel werden wir unsere Ambitionen für Klimagerechtigkeit in Angriff nehmen. Wir haben es geschafft, die Emissionen durch die Rettung der Wälder zu reduzieren. Wir können nicht allein handeln. Wir brauchen alle, um zu handeln. Die Mittel zur Umsetzung müssen mit unseren Entscheidungen und Zielen in Einklang gebracht werden.""

Was bedeutet also ""Mittel zur Umsetzung"" - und warum ist es so wichtig?

Die Architektur des Pariser Abkommens sieht vor, dass jedes Land einen nationalen Beitrag (Nationally Determined Contribution - NDC) erstellt und umsetzt, der Minderungs- und Anpassungsmaßnahmen UND die Mittel - Finanzierung, Technologietransfer und Kapazitätsaufbau - umfasst, mit denen dies umgesetzt werden soll. Die aktuellen NDCs (2021 bis 2030) enthalten länderspezifische Klimaziele und Pläne, die sowohl bedingungslos als auch konditional oder abhängig von internationalen Prozessen sind.

Wie die Industrieländer verpflichtet sind, den Tschad, Nepal oder Barbados bei der Erfüllung ihrer NDC-Ziele zu unterstützen, ist in den Artikeln 9, 10 und 11 des Pariser Abkommens geregelt. Artikel 9 besagt, dass die Industrieländer Finanzmittel bereitstellen und mobilisieren sollen, während andere Länder dies freiwillig tun können. In Artikel 10 heißt es, dass Entwicklungsländer bei der Entwicklung und dem Transfer von Technologien unterstützt werden, um ihre Widerstandsfähigkeit gegenüber dem Klimawandel zu verbessern und die Treibhausgasemissionen zu verringern, einschließlich finanzieller Unterstützung. Artikel 11 befasst sich mit dem Aufbau von Kapazitäten in den Entwicklungsländern, insbesondere in den am wenigsten entwickelten Ländern und in den Ländern, die am stärksten von den negativen Auswirkungen des Klimawandels betroffen sind, wie z. B. kleine Inselstaaten.

Wenn also Blöcke wie die G77 plus China (135 Länder) und die gleichgesinnten Entwicklungsländer (LMDC - 20 Nationen) über die Umsetzung des Pariser Abkommens lamentieren, beziehen sie sich oft auf die oben genannten Verpflichtungen, die größtenteils nicht erfüllt wurden.

Derzeit benötigen die Entwicklungsländer laut UNFCCC 5 bis 11 Mrd. US-Dollar für die Umsetzung der aktuellen NDCs, die 2030 auslaufen - wobei diese riesige Finanzierungslücke nur 30 % der tatsächlichen Kosten abdeckt.

Das ist einer der Gründe, warum die Entwicklungsländer einen Ausstieg aus der Nutzung fossiler Brennstoffe - oder irgendein neues Ziel - ohne Mittel zur Umsetzung einfach nicht akzeptieren können, da sie schon jetzt nicht einmal in der Lage sind, ihre aktuellen Pläne zur Eindämmung und Anpassung zu finanzieren (während die Kosten für Verluste und Schäden in die Höhe schnellen).

Nun zur globalen Bestandsaufnahme (GST) - der alle fünf Jahre vorgeschriebenen Bewertung der kollektiven Fortschritte bei den Pariser Verpflichtungen.Das Ergebnis dieser Bestandsaufnahme ist deshalb so wichtig, weil es für die nächste Runde der NDCs, die bis 2025 vorgelegt werden müssen, maßgeblich sein wird.

Das wird jetzt etwas langatmig, aber ich möchte noch einen weiteren Artikel anführen - 9.5 -, der von den Industrieländern verlangt, im Voraus Informationen darüber zu liefern, welche öffentlichen Mittel verfügbar sein werden, um die NDCs der ärmeren Länder zu unterstützen. Aber das ist einfach nicht geschehen. Und erinnern Sie sich an die 100 Milliarden Dollar pro Jahr für Klimaschutzmaßnahmen, die bis 2020 mobilisiert werden sollen - eine Zahl, die die USA in Kopenhagen ins Spiel gebracht haben, die aber nie umgesetzt wurde. Nun, diese Zahl wurde mehr oder weniger aus der Luft gegriffen, so dass sich die Länder im nächsten Jahr auf eine höhere, bedarfsgerechte jährliche Finanzierungssumme New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) einigen müssen.Die Industrieländer sagen, dass alle bedeutungsvollen Gespräche über die Finanzierung bis dahin verschoben werden sollten, während die Entwicklungsländer sagen, dass sie Details über die Finanzierung und die Mittel zur Umsetzung in der GST, dem globalen Anpassungsziel und dem gerechten Übergangsprogramm benötigen, da sie sonst einfach zum Scheitern verurteilt sind.

Wie Meena Raman vom Third World Network in Malaysia - die unglaublich hilfreich war, um dieses Thema zu verstehen - sagt: ""Ohne Mittel zur Umsetzung sind das alles nur Worte.""",2,4,2023-12-12 09:45:39,de,Klimawandel

Eine Recherche im jüngsten IPCC-Bericht","In diesem Artikel [https://www.reddit.com/r/Klimawandel/comments/186nkqp/monitoringbericht\_der\_bundesregierung\_erschienen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Klimawandel/comments/186nkqp/monitoringbericht_der_bundesregierung_erschienen/) warf u/intelligent-worker91 die [Frage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Klimawandel/comments/186nkqp/comment/kbd1y3b/) auf, ob sich das Klima in der Vergangenheit nicht stärker verändert hat, als wir üblicherweise anerkennen. Er [verwies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Klimawandel/comments/186nkqp/comment/kbe0xme/) dann als Beleg auf den Artikel eines gewissen Dr. Koelle. Ich habe mir das mal angeschaut und habe mal nachgelesen, was der IPCC dazu sagt. Ich dachte, mein Ergebnis ist vielleicht auch für andere interessant, darum kopiere ich hier mal meinen Kommentar hinein:

&#x200B;

 

Dr.  Koelle, der beim Klimaskeptiker-Verein EIKE aktiv zu sein scheint. Na,  schauen wir mal, was der zu sagen hat... Leider ist bei diesem Artikel  das deutsche Original nicht zu finden. Also muss ich drauf vertrauen,  dass die Übersetzung so stimmt und auch keine Infos verloren gegangen  sind.

Das ist hier allerdings ein  zentrales Problem bei dieser Quelle: Keine einzige Aussage oder  Abbildung im Text ist mit einer klaren Quelle unterlegt, die man prüfen  könnte. Bzw. mit der man prüfen könnte, ob der Autor die Quelle korrekt  wiedergegeben hat. Insbesondere bei Figure 2, auf die Du vermutlich  anspielst, würde mich eine Quelle interessieren. Dass diese nicht  angegeben ist, muss sehr stutzig machen bei einem Artikel, der  Wissenschaftlichkeit suggeriert.

(Unter  dem Text sind Quellen angegeben, ich weiß. Ich müsste die jetzt einzeln  durchgehen um herauszufinden, woher denn Fig. 2 her kommt. So macht man  das in der Wissenschaft aus guten Gründen nicht, denn viel zu aufwändig  und daher intransparent, siehe die Studien weiter unten mit hunderten  bis tausenden Quellen.)

Von daher  bleibt die Frage nach einem belastbaren Beleg für Deine Hypothese mit  der warmen Antike offen. Aber ich habe die aufgeworfene Frage mal zum  Anlass genommen, mir das im letzten IPCC-Bericht noch mal näher  anzuschauen. Und das ist spannend und es stellt sich heraus, dass es vor  4.000 Jahren offenbar tatsächlich ziemlich warm war auf der Erde. Das  war aber vor dem römischen Reich.

Relevant ist hier der 2.500-Seiten starke Bericht der Arbeitsgruppe 1, den Du hier findest: [https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-i/](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-i/).  In Kapitel 2 geht unter anderem um die Rekonstruktion des Klimas der  Vergangenheit. Interessant für unsere Frage ist Abbildung 2.11 ([https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC\_AR6\_WGI\_Figure\_2\_11.png](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/figures/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Figure_2_11.png)):

Relevant  ist der obere Bereicht, für die Zeit des römischen Reichs insbesondere  der linke (blaue) Bereich. Dargestellt ist ein Bereich der möglichen  Temperatur-Verteilung - die obere und die untere Grenze sowie der  Mittelwert, der für den AR 6 letztlich verwendet wird. Man sieht hier  verschiedenes interessantes:

1. In der ferneren Vergangenheit (ca. 4000 v.C.) weisen viele Indizien auf eine recht hohe Temperatur hin.
2. Allerdings liegen die Schätzungen für diese Periode gut 1 Grad auseinander.
3. Der obere Rand der Schätzungen entspricht ungefähr der heutigen Temperatur.

Schauen wir uns das genauer an. Die Datenquellen finden sich im ""Supplementary Material"" zum Kapitel 2: [https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC\_AR6\_WGI\_Chapter02\_SM.pdf](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter02_SM.pdf)  Figure 2.11a (a für den oberen Bereich) ist als Quelle Kaufman et al  (2020a, b) angegeben. Laut Quellenverzeichnis weiter hinten handelt es  sich um diese beiden frei zugänglichen Veröffentlichungen:

[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0445-3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0445-3) (30.4.20 erschienen) und [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0530-7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0530-7) (30.6.20)

In  der ersten Publikation beschreiben sie die Datenbank von weltweiten  paläoklimatologischen Records (Datenpunkte). Diese umfasst 1.319  Datenpunkte von 679 Orten (jeweils belegt mit einer konkreten  wissenschaftlichen Studie, siehe das Quellenverzeichnis der Publikation  mit mehr als 500 Einträgen). Die Arten der Datenpunkte sind:  ""lake  sediment (51%), marine sediment (31%), peat (11%), glacier ice (3%), and  other natural archives"" - also eine Reihe unterschiedlicher Verfahren  kamen hier zum Einsatz.

In der  zweiten Publikation haben sie diese Daten dann ausgewertet und haben  versucht mit verschiedenen Methoden das Klima der Periode 10.000 v.C.  bis heute (12.000 Jahre) zu rekonstruieren (verschiedene Verfahren >> verschiedene Linien). Man kommt auf einen  Schwankungsbereich, so wie er auch in der AR 6-Figure 2.11 dargestellt  ist. In Figure 3 der Veröffentlichung ([Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0530-7/figures/3))  wird dann die Schätzung für die globale Temperatur in ihrer  Schwankungsbreite dargestellt, wie sie dann auch in den AR 6 einfloss:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3qsk4ff8jh3c1.jpg?width=892&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76e8c003854adc8707cb7b832e0e5acd623bbcba

Das  ist nun die wissenschaftliche Datengrundlage für den neuesten  IPCC-Bericht AR 6. Alles sauber nachvollziehbar, klare Aussage: Man weiß  nicht genau, wie das Klima vor 2.000 oder 4.000 oder 12.000 Jahren war,  aber man kann es mit einem gewissen Schwankungsbereich abschätzen (der  für mich unerwartet  groß ist).

Da  kann man nun schauen, ob die Forscher da Fehler gemacht haben: Haben  sie Daten unzulässig ausgeschlossen? Sind ihre Modelle falsch? Und  natürlich gibt es auch wissenschaftliche Diskussion darum (verschiedenes  wird im AR 6 vermutlich auch dargestellt), die Wissenschaft entwickelt  sich weiter und im nächsten Bericht wird es hier vermutlich ein Update  mit besseren Daten und Methoden geben.

Der  Punkt, bei dem ich hier hinaus will: Die Wissenschaft ist offen für  Kritik. Diese muss den Stand der Wissenschaft aber anerkennen, sich  damit auseinandersetzen. Und das tut Dr. Dietrich Koelle nicht wirklich,  der Autor des von Dir verlinkten Artikels. Der hat nie selbst in der  Klimawissenschaft geforscht, sich also nie mit den dort angewandten  Methoden beschäftigt, kann damit gar nicht wirklich einschätzen, ob die  Methoden sinnvoll sind oder nicht. Stattdessen greift er sich einzelne  Hypothesen heraus und behauptet, diese im Vergleich doch recht  schlichten Hypothesen könnten das Klima besser erklären. (Nebenbei  bemerkt sind die Temperaturen seit 2015, als dieser Artikel erschien, ja  deutlich weiter gestiegen. Wie passt das wohl in seine Annahmen?)

Nun  könnte man sagen: Beschäftigt sich die Klimawissenschaft denn mit den  Argumenten der Kritiker? Natürlich tut sie das! Ob Temperatur- oder  Sonnenstrahlungs-Zyklen usw. die Entwicklung der Temperatur der  Atmosphäre erklären können, das lässt sich ja prüfen. Teilweise wurde  festgestellt, dass solche Zyklen tatsächlich relevant sind, siehe bspw.  Abschnitt  2.3.1.4.2, wo beschrieben wird, wie mehrtausendjährige  Orbit-Zyklen sich auf den Monsun auswirken. Das wird in die Klimamodelle  dann aufgenommen. Oder such im WG-1-Bericht mal nach ""Solar Cycle"":  Gibt eine Reihe von Fundstellen, wo beschrieben wird, wo sie tatsächlich  Relevanz haben. Sollten dort aber neue, starke Erkenntnisse aufkommen,  würde die Community das sicher (früher oder später) prüfen und ggf. in  Modellen aufgreifen.

So  funktioniert Klimawissenschaft. Es gibt keine  Klimawissenschaftler-Verschwörung. Alle wollen das Klima noch besser  verstehen, damit wir besser wissen, was uns blüht und wie wir vermeiden  können, was uns blüht.",25,2,2023-11-30 08:15:11,de,Klimawandel

187iiez,Die wichtigsten Fakten im Überblick – Einblick in die Klimakrise," Hallo r/Klimawandel\-Community!

In diesem Post möchte ich euch einige Schlüsselaspekte der Klimakrise näherbringen, basierend auf einem aktuellen Artikel des Guardian. Hier sind die wichtigsten Punkte, einfach und verständlich erklärt:

* **CO₂-Emissionen nach Regionen**: Während die Emissionen in Europa und Amerika stabilisieren, steigen sie in Asien und Afrika an. Interessant ist, dass, wenn man die Emissionen pro Kopf betrachtet, Länder wie die USA und Australien, aber auch Russland und Staaten im Nahen Osten wie Saudi-Arabien und Katar in den Fokus rücken​.
* **Hauptquellen der Treibhausgase**: Der Energiesektor ist mit 27 % der größte Emittent von Treibhausgasen. Der Industriesektor folgt mit 22 % und Landwirtschaft, Forstwirtschaft sowie Landnutzungsänderungen tragen 20 % bei. Interessanterweise hat sich der jährliche Verlust an Baumbeständen in den vergangenen zwei Jahrzehnten allmählich erhöht​.
* **Entwicklung der CO₂-Emissionen**: Seit Beginn der Industrialisierung steigen die CO₂-Emissionen stetig an. Der Planet konnte diese Emissionen zunächst in natürlichen „Kohlenstoffsenken“ wie Wäldern und Ozeanen aufnehmen, aber mit der Zeit wurden mehr Emissionen in der Atmosphäre gefangen​.
* **Globale Erwärmung**: Die durchschnittliche globale Temperatur ist im Vergleich zum 20. Jahrhundert um 1,2 Grad Celsius gestiegen. Dieser Anstieg hat lokale und monatliche Unterschiede, wie der September 2023, der fast 2 Grad wärmer war als der September 1956.
* **Meeresspiegelanstieg**: In den letzten 140 Jahren ist der Meeresspiegel weltweit um fast 25 Zentimeter gestiegen, wobei ein Drittel dieses Anstiegs in den vergangenen 25 Jahren erfolgte. Besonders betroffen ist die Arktis, die sich schneller erwärmt als andere Regionen​.

186mo0m,Rechtskampf eines peruanischen Bauern gegen Energiegigant RWE wegen Klimawandelauswirkungen,"In den peruanischen Anden entfaltet sich ein bahnbrechender Rechtsfall: Der Bauer Saúl Luciano Lliuya hält den deutschen Energiekonzern RWE für die Auswirkungen des Klimawandels verantwortlich. Dieser beispiellose Rechtsfall basiert auf dem Konzept des „Nachbarschaftsrechts“ und RWEs Beitrag zu den globalen Treibhausgasemissionen, geschätzt auf 0,47 %. Lliuyas Kampf begann in seinem kleinen Dorf Llupa und hat mittlerweile internationale Aufmerksamkeit erlangt, die ihn bis in deutsche Gerichte und zu UN-Gipfeln führte.

Im Zentrum der Klage steht das Risiko durch das Schmelzen der Gletscher in der Nähe des Sees Palcacocha, das eine katastrophale Überschwemmung in Lliuyas Region droht. Seine rechtliche Forderung ist nicht nur persönlich, sondern repräsentiert einen größeren Kampf für Klimagerechtigkeit, in dem große Verschmutzer für ihre globale Auswirkung zur Verantwortung gezogen werden. Der Prozess, der 2015 begann, hat mehrere Wendungen erlebt, einschließlich einer anfänglichen Ablehnung in einem unteren Gericht und späterer Zulassung in einem höheren Gericht. Der Fall hat internationales Interesse geweckt und ähnliche Klagen weltweit ausgelöst, was eine wachsende Bewegung gegen große Emittenten und ihre Rolle beim Klimawandel widerspiegelt.

Dieser Fall ist nicht nur rechtlich, sondern auch tief persönlich für Lliuya. Er hat Skepsis und Missverständnisse in seiner Gemeinde erlebt, bleibt aber standhaft in seinem Kampf, angetrieben von einer tiefen Verbindung zu seinem Land und den wachsenden Gefahren durch den Klimawandel. Seine Ausdauer angesichts von Herausforderungen ist emblematisch für einen globalen Kampf um Umweltgerechtigkeit und Verantwortlichkeit.

185suz8,🌍 Positive Entwicklungen im Klimawandel: Ein Hoffnungsschimmer?," Hallo r/klimawandel\-Community!

Ich möchte mit euch einen kürzlich veröffentlichten Artikel auf phys.org diskutieren, der sich mit ""Drei positiven Klimaentwicklungen"" befasst. 

Trotz der anhaltenden Herausforderungen im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel gibt es einige aufmunternde Fortschritte:

1. **Gedämpfte Erwärmungsprognosen**: Nach dem Pariser Abkommen hat sich die Prognose der globalen Erwärmung leicht verbessert, obwohl sie immer noch kritische Werte erreicht.
2. **Spitze der Emissionen in Sicht?** Es gibt Anzeichen dafür, dass die jährlichen Treibhausgasemissionen ihren Höhepunkt früher erreichen könnten als erwartet, möglicherweise sogar schon in diesem Jahr.
3. **Aufstieg der erneuerbaren Energien**: Solar-, Windenergie und Elektrofahrzeuge treiben die Verbesserung der globalen Erwärmungsprognosen seit 2015 voran, mit deutlichen Zuwächsen in der sauberen Energie-Technologie.

Diese Entwicklungen zeigen, dass Fortschritte möglich sind, auch wenn sie noch weit von dem entfernt sind, was nötig wäre. Was denkt ihr darüber? Welche weiteren Maßnahmen sollten ergriffen werden, um diese positiven Trends zu verstärken?

Konkret interessieren mich die südlichen Regionen Spaniens, aber ich fände das generell spannend.

Wenn Frau Klatten über die Politik klagt, dass es zu viel Regulation gibt, ist das ein gutes Zeichen. Die enttäuschenden Erfahrungen, dass Entscheidungsträger und Regierende immer wieder das Klima vernachlässigen oder ihm schaden, rüht unter anderem daher, dass klimafreundliche Entscheidungen nicht mehrheitsfähig sind wegen der massiven Abwehr aus der Bevölkerung und der Wirtschaft. Selbst wenn entsprechende Entscheidung getroffen werden, kann es in der Umsetzung immernoch passieren, dass es keine Unterstützung für bestimmte Maßnahmen gibt. Dennoch ist jede politische Bewegung Richtung Klimafreundlichkeit dem Leben und Überleben auf diesem gebeutelten Planeten dienlich.

Natürlich gibt es nicht ""die Politik"" oder ""die Wirtschaft"". Ich möchte folgendes ausdrücken: Wenn Frau Klatten als Vertreterin der Wirtschaft sich über Regulation beschwert, lese ich das gerne als eine Emanzipation der Politik von der Wirtschaft. Gerne würde ich mehr davon lesen.

Das Deutschlandticket wird von ca. 11 Mio. Menschen genutzt (bzw. ist in deren Besitz). Die Finanzierung steht aktuell wegen ""läppischer"" eine Milliarde Euro im Zweifel, eine Erhöhung des Ticketpreises würde die Akzeptanz deutlich reduzieren.

Was wäre denn, wenn man einen ""ÖPNV-Beitragsservice"" einrichtet, ähnlich dem Rundfunk? Durch die damit verbundene Vergabe des Tickets an alle Deutschen Bürger würde die Attraktivität nochmals steigen - wenn man das Ticket ""ohnehin"" schon hat, wird es auch genutzt.

Im Gegenzug könnte man den Rundfunkbeitrag abschaffen, um den Bürger zu entlasten. Denn während ÖPNV dem Klimaschutz viel Gutes tut und gesellschaftlichen Mehrwert liefert, tut es das andere nicht...

Und wenn die 18,36 dann monatlich an die ÖPNV-Anbieter gehen, kann die Qualität nochmals deutlich optimiert werden!

17k2isv,"Das Argument gegen Degrowth, welches ich nicht widerlegen konnte","Hallo zusammen, auch wenn das Thema ziemlich umfassend ist, versuche ich mich einigermaßen kurz zu halten.

Ich denke wir sind uns alle einig, dass unser aller Ziel das langfristige Überleben auf der Erde ist. Die einen schlagen als Lösungsweg ""Grünes Wachstum"" vor, also die Entkopplung von Technologie und den daraus entstehenden Umweltschäden durch z.B. Erneuerbare Energien. Diese Diskussion soll aber das Thema Degrowth behandeln, also lasst bitte alles, was grünes Wachstum oder erneuerbare Energien beinhaltet, raus. 

Degrowth bedeutet, unsere Gesellschaft so umzugestalten, dass wir keine negativen Auswirkungen auf unsere Umwelt haben und weniger bzw. gleich viel Ressourcen verbrauchen, wie die Erde produzieren kann. Umgesetzt wird das durch ein Wirtschaftsschrumpfen, indem alle Sektoren, die nicht zwingend zum Überleben benötigt werden, ""verboten"" werden. Zum Beispiel würde die Automobil- und Flugzeugbranche nahezu abgeschafft werden, im Gesundheitswesen und Bildungsbranche dürfte es jedoch keine Einschränkungen geben. Das meiner Meinung nach realistischste Szenario ist die ""Post-Wachstums-Ökonomie"" von Niko Paech (ich behaupte nicht, dass dieses Szenario tatsächlich realistisch ist, aber von alle Szenarien ist es immerhin am wenigsten abwegig). Wer sich dafür mehr interessiert, einfach Niko Paech googlen. Im Prinzip ist Degrowth ein großer Verzicht auf Wohlstand und Luxus, um so unser Überleben auf der Erde zu sichern.

Nun das Argument, um das es hier gehen soll:

Wie ich schon erklärt habe, geht im Prinzip alles darum, wie wir langfristig unser Überleben sichern können. Dabei ist vor allem der Klimawandel in den letzten Jahren stark aufgekocht und wird als Hauptbedrohung angesehen. Leider wird schnell vergessen, dass der Klimawandel weder die einzige, noch die wahrscheinlichste Bedrohung für uns ist.

Alle ""großen"" Bedrohungen lassen sich praktisch in zwei Kategorien unterteilen: Natürliche Bedrohungen (z.B. Supervulkan-Ausbruch, Pandemie, Asteroid) und menschengemachte Bedrohungen (Atomkrieg, KI, Klimawandel). Es ist wichtig zu verstehen, dass die Menschheit unglaublich resilient ist. Trifft eine dieser Bedrohungen ein, würden wir zwar große Schäden davontragen, jedoch würden wir uns aufgrund unserer Resilienz ""schnell"" wieder aufbauen und weiterleben können. Zum Beispiel würden bei einem Atomkrieg ca. 40% aller Menschen überleben, was momentan 3,2 Milliarden Menschen und somit mehr Menschen, als es im Jahre 1950 überhaupt auf der Erde gab, entsprechen würde. Bei den anderen Bedrohungen ist es ähnlich. Tatsächlich gibt es nur **ein einziges** Szenario, dass uns als menschliche Spezies tatsächlich ernsthaft und bleibend schädigen könnte: Eine Ansammlung mehrerer dieser Bedrohungen innerhalb einer kurzen Zeitspanne (z.B. Klimawandel -> 200 Jahre später Atomkrieg -> 300 Jahre später Pandemie).

Nun zum Degrowth. Der Vorteil von Degrowth besteht darin, dass keine menschengemachten Bedrohungen entstehen würden, weil keine Technologien erforscht werden, die über Überlebensnotwendiges hinaus gingen. Also keine Gefahr durch Klimawandel, KI, Atomkrieg usw.. Jedoch geht es hier nicht um einzelne Bedrohungen, sondern um das einzige wirklich gefährliche Szenario, nämlich eine Akkumulation dieser Bedrohungen. Das Problem ist, dass wir vor natürlichen Bedrohungen, die rein statistisch gesehen mit sehr hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit in der Zukunft auftreten werden, nicht geschützt wären, weil wir für dessen Bewältigung gerade diese Technologien benötigen, die wir in einer Degrowth-Ökonomie nie erforschen würden. Ich weiß, dass technologischer Fortschritt nicht mit dem BIP zusammenhängt. In einer Degrowth Ökonomie müsste der technologische Fortschritt jedoch trotzdem deutlich eingeschränkt werden, da sie sonst weder ihr Ziel erfüllt, noch realistisch umsetzbar wäre. Demnach MUSS es eine Stagnation oder mindestens eine Verlangsamung des technologischen Fortschritts geben, wenn eine Degrowth-Ökonomie in der Realität implementiert werden soll. Mehr dazu wie gesagt bei Niko Paechs Versuch, ein möglichst realistisches Szenario aufzubauen. Durch Degrowth wären wir also vor menschengemachten Bedrohungen geschützt, verlieren jedoch die Fähigkeit, gegen eine Akkumulation gewappnet zu sein.

Mir ist bewusst, dass der Weg des ""grünen Wachstums"" auch Gefahren und Probleme aufweist, aber wie gesagt soll es hier um Degrowth gehen. Ich möchte hiermit eher auf das Dilemma aufmerksam machen, in dem wir uns befinden.

Also was denkt ihr darüber? Nach diesem Argument wäre Degrowth leider auch keine Lösung, sondern eher unser Untergang. Wir würden dadurch jegliche Kontrolle abgeben.  


&#x200B;

Anmerkung: Bitte versucht, über dieses Argument zu diskutieren und nicht über andere Sachen wie z.B. die Umsetzbarkeit einer Degrowth-Ökonomie. Das würde den Rahmen komplett sprengen. Lasst uns einfach davon ausgehen, dass wir in der Post-Wachstums-Ökonomie von Niko Paech leben würden, auch wenn das wohl nie passieren wird.",6,46,2023-10-30 16:15:29,de,Klimawandel

Sc. in Physik im Heimtland meiner Eltern, wo ich die Mittel- und Hochschule absolviert habe. Mit 30, mache ich mir jetzt über einen Master und eventuell PhD gedanken, und ob ich es vielleicht in Deutschland machen soll, und daher habe ich auch intensiv angefangen, mich mit der deutschen Politik zu beschäftigen, da ich glaube, dass dies die civile Verantwortung jedes einen ist, der in einem Land leben möchte. 

Mir wurde während meines Studium beigebracht, das Kernkraft, komperativ zur Kohle, die weit aus ""gesündere"" Option sei, da nach allen Daten weltweit, sind weniger Menschen pro kWh an Krebs und ähnlichen erkrankt, als von Kohleenergie. Und die Differenz sei auch nicht klein, sondern extrem groß. Desweiteren, verschmutzt es Länder ""in der dritten Welt"", weit aus weniger Uranium (das ja auch sicher ist wen es nicht angereicht ist) abzubauen, als Cobalt und co. 

Ich kann auch verstehen, das einige Deutsche vor dem Schalgwort: ""Nukleare Energie"" angst haben, jedoch wie ist es dazu gekommen, dass die anti-nuklear Welle so stark wird? Kohle-Lobby?

17152jz,Klimawandel und kognitive Dissonanz,"In einer Welt, die von Informationen überflutet ist, könnte man denken, dass faktisches und wissenschaftliches Wissen leicht in das öffentliche Bewusstsein eindringen würde. Dies ist jedoch weit gefehlt. Von der Leugnung des Klimawandels bis hin zu Bewegungen gegen Impfungen gibt es eine beunruhigende Kluft zwischen wissenschaftlichem Konsens und öffentlicher Meinung.

Warum fällt es den Menschen so schwer, ihre Weltanschauungen angesichts neuer Erkenntnisse anzupassen?

Um dies zu untersuchen, können wir die von Sigmund Freud und Leon Festinger vorgeschlagenen psychologischen Theorien betrachten.

Sigmund Freud beschrieb mehrere ""narzisstische Verletzungen"", mit denen die Menschen im Laufe der Geschichte konfrontiert wurden:

Die kopernikanische Revolution: Wir erfuhren, dass die Erde nicht das Zentrum des Universums ist.

Darwins Evolutionstheorie: Die Menschheit ist keine besondere Schöpfung, sondern ein Produkt der Evolution.

Freuds Psychoanalyse: Wir sind keine vollkommen rationalen Wesen; das Unbewusste beeinflusst unsere Handlungen erheblich.

Jeder dieser Durchbrüche erschütterte die selbstzentrierte Sicht der Menschheit auf die Welt und verursachte psychologische Belastungen und Ablehnung. Die Annahme dieser Wahrheiten bedeutete, eine aufgeblasene Sicht der menschlichen Bedeutung aufzugeben.

Auch wenn der Klimawandel ein drängendes Beispiel ist, ist er bei weitem nicht die einzige wissenschaftliche Wahrheit, mit der die Menschen derzeit zu kämpfen haben. Die Probleme reichen von genetischer Modifikation bis künstlicher Intelligenz, von Impfungen bis zu Theorien über die Ursprünge des Universums. In jedem Fall destabilisieren die wissenschaftlichen Fakten oft tief verwurzelte Überzeugungen oder soziale Konstrukte, was zu einer Reihe defensiver psychologischer Reaktionen führt.

Leon Festingers Theorie der ""kognitiven Dissonanz"" besagt, dass Individuen mentale Unbehagen erleben, wenn sie auf Informationen stoßen, die mit ihren bestehenden Überzeugungen oder Werten in Konflikt stehen. Dieses Unbehagen führt oft zur Verleugnung oder Veränderung der neuen Fakten, um sie in vorbestehende Weltanschauungen zu integrieren.

Wissenschaftliche Wahrheiten sind oft schwer zu akzeptieren, weil sie nicht nur individuelle Überzeugungen, sondern kollektive Identitäten herausfordern. Ob es sich um religiöse Gemeinschaften, politische Zugehörigkeiten oder soziale Gruppen handelt, Menschen lehnen Fakten eher ab, die den Zusammenhalt und die geteilten Überzeugungen ihres ""Stammes"" bedrohen.

Obwohl das Internet den Zugang zu Informationen demokratisiert hat, hat es auch eine Plattform für Echokammern bereitgestellt. Die Menschen haben nun den Luxus, nur die Informationen zu konsumieren, die mit ihren Überzeugungen übereinstimmen, was Ignoranz und Leugnung weiter verstärkt.

Das Verständnis der psychologischen Mechanismen, die es schwer machen, unbequeme wissenschaftliche Wahrheiten zu akzeptieren, ist der erste Schritt zur Überbrückung der Kluft zwischen wissenschaftlichen Gemeinschaften und der Allgemeinheit.

Wir müssen den Einfluss von kognitiver Dissonanz, narzisstischen Verletzungen und Stammeszugehörigkeiten auf unsere Wahrnehmung der Gesellschaft erkennen. Nur dann können wir gezielte Bildungs- und Kommunikationsstrategien entwickeln, um Leugnung und Ignoranz entgegenzuwirken.",39,110,2023-10-06 02:23:56,de,Klimawandel

Dies bedeutet jedoch nicht, dass das Kind jedes Jahr direkt diese Emissionen verursacht. Stattdessen wurde der gesamte CO2-Ausstoß, der durch die Erziehung eines Kindes (von Geburt bis Erwachsenenalter) entsteht, über eine angenommene Lebensdauer von 80 Jahren des Elternteils verteilt. Das entspricht über diesen Zeitraum beeindruckenden 2.880 Flügen.

Überbevölkerung stellt eine der größten Bedrohungen für unseren Planeten dar. Mehr Menschen bedeuten unweigerlich mehr Verbrauch, Abfall und Belastung für bereits schwindende Ressourcen. Prognosen zeigen einen möglichen Anstieg der Weltbevölkerung um 2 bis 3 Milliarden bis 2050. Mit steigenden Zahlen werden die Herausforderungen, ausreichend Nahrung, sauberes Wasser und grundlegende Dienstleistungen bereitzustellen, immer akuter.

Hintergrund war der Streit darum, dass Reddit die Kosten für third-party-applications zum ersten Juli deutlichst erhöht. Eine gute Beschreibung der Hintergründe findet Ihr hier ([https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749188/reddit-subreddit-private-protest-api-changes-apollo-charges](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749188/reddit-subreddit-private-protest-api-changes-apollo-charges)). 

Mittlerweile steht eine erste Drohung von reddit im Raum, die Mods der betreffenden subs zu entfernen und Mods einzusetzen, die gewillt sind, die betreffenden subreddits im Sinne reddits offenzuhalten und weiterzuführen ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/14ahxda/reddit\_threatens\_to\_remove\_moderators\_from/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/14ahxda/reddit_threatens_to_remove_moderators_from/)). Noch ist es eine Drohung, die nur so im Raum steht. Einige subs (vermutlich im wesentlichen die großen englischsprachigen) wurden dementsprechend wohl schon angeschrieben. 

Die Wahl scheint also derzeit wohl zu sein: Ein sub zu schließen und es damit indirekt anderen Moderator:innen anzuvertrauen, solchen, die reddit dafür geeignet hält – was immer das heißt. Uns scheint die bessere Wahl, dieses sub erst einmal von privat auf restricted und später gegebenenfalls wieder auf offen zu setzen, um die Möglichkeit zu haben, auszuloten, was geschehen wird, und abgesehen davon, den Diskussionsraum für das eigentliche Anliegen des subs wieder zu eröffnen, auch Kritik an reddits Politik sichtbar zu halten.

Ich dachte, einige von euch könnten die Buchtauschplattform, die mein Freund und ich erstellt haben, nützlich finden. Bei [Buchbaum](https://buchbaum.de/) können Nutzer\*innen ein neues Zuhause für ihre gelesenen Bücher finden, anstatt sie ungenutzt im Regal verstauben zu lassen – und gleichzeitig neue Bücher für sich selbst entdecken. Unser Ziel ist es, die Lebensdauer von Büchern zu verlängern und einen Beitrag zur Ressourcenschonung zu leisten.

Hier sind ein paar „interessante“ Fakten zur Buchindustrie:

* Laut dem Umweltinstitut München müssen für eine Million Exemplare eines 250-seitigen Buches mehr als **12.000 Bäume** gefällt werden.
* Der Druck und Verkauf von **zehn Büchern** verursacht **11 kg Kohlendioxid**, was dem Pro-Kopf-Fußabdruck eines Fluges von Frankfurt nach Berlin mit einer vollbesetzten 737 entspricht.
* Abholzung, Verarbeitung und Druck setzen **Kohlenmonoxide** und **Stickoxide** in die Atmosphäre frei – beides Treibhausgase, die Wärme in der Atmosphäre halten.
* Beim Bleichen von Papier mit Chlor entstehen **Dioxine**. Diese sind krebserregend und brauchen Jahrzehnte, um abgebaut zu werden.
* Rund **80 Prozent** der benötigten Fasern werden nach Deutschland importiert und stammen nicht aus Recyclingpapier.

Also ja, falls ihr oder jemand, den ihr kennt, das interessant finden könnte, teilt es gerne! Es würde uns sehr viel bedeuten. 💚

Durch die rasante Erwärmung der Arktis tauen diese Böden auf und setzen gefährliche Stoffe frei, die lokale Ökosysteme und die Gesundheit der dort lebenden Menschen bedrohen. Forschende, darunter ein Team des Alfred-Wegener-Instituts, untersuchen nun das Ausmaß dieser Bedrohung im kanadischen Mackenzie-Delta. Sie nehmen Boden- und Wasserproben, um die Risiken für die Umwelt besser einschätzen zu können. Besonders bedenklich ist die Situation in Russland, wo Daten über kontaminierte Flächen fehlen und der wissenschaftliche Austausch durch geopolitische Spannungen erschwert ist.

1e1g6pg,Die Welt investiert doppelt so viel in saubere Energie wie in fossile Brennstoffe - Ein entscheidender Schritt zur Nachhaltigkeit,"Hallo r/umwelt Community,

Die Welt steht an einem entscheidenden Punkt in ihrer Energiegeschichte. Investitionen in Energieinfrastrukturen sind entscheidend für nachhaltige Entwicklung und die Bekämpfung des Klimawandels. Ein aktueller Bericht der Internationalen Energieagentur (IEA) zeigt, dass Investitionen in saubere Energien erstmals die Investitionen in fossile Brennstoffe übertroffen haben. Diese Verschiebung markiert einen bedeutenden Schritt in Richtung einer nachhaltigen Energiezukunft und erfordert ein umfassendes Verständnis der aktuellen Investitionstrends und Herausforderungen.

🌍 G**lobale Investitionstrends:** 2024 werden die globalen Energieinvestitionen erstmals die Marke von 3 Billionen USD überschreiten, wobei 2 Billionen USD in saubere Energietechnologien und -infrastrukturen fließen. Solarenergie zieht mittlerweile mehr Investitionen an als alle anderen Erzeugungstechnologien zusammen, was zeigt, dass erneuerbare Energien nicht nur umweltfreundlicher, sondern auch wirtschaftlich attraktiver geworden sind.

🌱 D**ie Rolle von Schwellenländern:** Schwellen- und Entwicklungsländer spielen eine entscheidende Rolle bei der globalen Energiewende. Obwohl sie vor erheblichen Herausforderungen stehen, zeigen Länder wie Indien, Brasilien und Teile Südostasiens Fortschritte durch neue politische Initiativen und öffentliche Ausschreibungen.

🔆 I**nvestitionen in Solarenergie:** Im Jahr 2024 werden die Investitionen in Solar-PV-Technologie voraussichtlich über 500 Milliarden USD betragen, unterstützt durch sinkende Kosten für Solarmodule und verbesserte Technologien.

⚡ **Netze und Speicher**: Die Integration erneuerbarer Energien hat zu einer Erholung der Investitionen in Netze und Speicher geführt. Diese sind entscheidend für die Stabilität und Zuverlässigkeit der Stromversorgung.

💸 F**inanzierungsherausforderungen und Lösungen:** Die Finanzierung sauberer Energien bleibt eine Herausforderung, insbesondere in Schwellenländern. Entwicklungsfinanzierungsinstitutionen (DFIs) spielen eine entscheidende Rolle bei der Risikominderung und der Mobilisierung privaten Kapitals.

🌍 R**egionale Unterschiede:** Es gibt erhebliche regionale Unterschiede in den Investitionsmustern. China wird 2024 den größten Betrag in saubere Energien investieren, gefolgt von der Europäischen Union und den USA.

Die Verschiebung der Investitionen hin zu sauberen Energien markiert einen bedeutenden Schritt in Richtung einer nachhaltigen Energiezukunft.

1dl0dql,Boom bei Wärmepumpen in Deutschland: Ein Überblick,"Der Einsatz von Wärmepumpen in neuen Wohngebäuden in Deutschland hat 2023 einen neuen Höchststand erreicht. Laut dem Statistischen Bundesamt nutzen knapp zwei Drittel (64,6 %) der 2023 fertiggestellten Wohngebäude diese Technologie zur primären Heizung. Dieser Anstieg verdeutlicht die zunehmende Bedeutung umweltfreundlicher Heizlösungen und reflektiert die verstärkten Bemühungen zur Reduktion von CO₂-Emissionen im Gebäudesektor.

**Aktuelle Statistiken:** Im Jahr 2023 haben Wärmepumpen beeindruckende 64,6 % der neu errichteten Wohngebäude erreicht, was einen signifikanten Anstieg gegenüber 2014 (31,8 %) darstellt. Wärmepumpen werden vor allem in Ein- und Zweifamilienhäusern genutzt, während ihr Einsatz in Mehrfamilienhäusern weniger verbreitet ist.

**Gründe für den Anstieg:** Der Boom lässt sich auf mehrere Faktoren zurückführen: Umweltpolitische Maßnahmen und staatliche Förderprogramme machen den Einbau finanziell attraktiv. Technologische Fortschritte haben die Effizienz und Zuverlässigkeit moderner Wärmepumpen erhöht. Energieversorger bieten Rabatte und Zuschüsse, was die Nutzung zusätzlich fördert.

**Vorteile von Wärmepumpen:** Wärmepumpen bieten hohe Energieeffizienz und nutzen erneuerbare Energiequellen wie Luft, Wasser oder Erdreich zur Wärmeerzeugung, was die CO₂-Emissionen deutlich reduziert. Langfristige Kosteneinsparungen durch geringere Betriebskosten und staatliche Förderungen machen sie wirtschaftlich attraktiv. Sie sind vielseitig einsetzbar und können sowohl zum Heizen als auch zum Kühlen verwendet werden.

**Herausforderungen und Kritik** Trotz der vielen Vorteile gibt es Herausforderungen: hohe Installationskosten, technische Voraussetzungen wie gut gedämmte Gebäude und ausreichend Platz für die Außeneinheiten. Auch Marktverfügbarkeit und Abhängigkeit von Strompreisen sind kritische Punkte.

**Produktion und Außenhandel:** Der Einsatz von Wärmepumpen spiegelt sich auch in der Produktion wider. 2023 wurden in Deutschland 400.100 Wärmepumpen hergestellt, ein Anstieg von 14 % gegenüber dem Vorjahr. Im vierten Quartal 2023 gab es jedoch einen Rückgang um 41,4 % gegenüber dem Vorquartal. Auch der Außenhandel zeigte ähnliche Trends mit einem Importanstieg von 39,2 % im Jahr 2023 und einem Rückgang im ersten Quartal 2024.

**Zukunftsaussichten:** Die Zukunft der Wärmepumpen sieht vielversprechend aus. Prognosen zeigen einen weiteren Anstieg bei Neubauten. Technologische Entwicklungen wie die Kombination von Wärmepumpen mit Solaranlagen und Photothermie könnten die Effizienz weiter verbessern. Die Integration von Smart-Home-Technologien könnte die Nutzung optimieren. Wärmepumpen könnten eine zentrale Rolle in der Energiewende spielen und zur Reduktion der CO₂-Emissionen im Wohnsektor beitragen.

**Fazit** Der Boom der Wärmepumpen zeigt die zunehmende Bedeutung nachhaltiger Heizlösungen. Trotz Herausforderungen wie Installationskosten und Marktverfügbarkeit haben Wärmepumpen das Potenzial, eine zentrale Rolle in der Energiewende zu spielen und die CO₂-Emissionen deutlich zu reduzieren. Die Zukunft der Wärmepumpen ist vielversprechend.

1djm4qw,Erneut Fischsterben in der Oder,"In der Oder sterben erneut massenhaft Fische. Auf polnischer Seite sind Flussabschnitte in der Nähe von Glogow betroffen. Die Fische sterben an einem Gift der Brackwasseralge Prymnesium parvum, die sonst nur an den Küsten vorkommt. Beim Fischsterben im Jahr 2022 lösten salzhaltige Abwässer aus den polnischen Kohlebergwerken zusammen mit hohen Wassertemperaturen das Wachstum dieser giftigen Algenart in den oberen Flussabschnitten der Oder aus. Diesen Zusammenhang hat Greenpeace vergangenes Jahr nachgewiesen und die Behörden in Polen und Deutschland darüber informiert.

Julios Kontchou, Ökotoxikologe von Greenpeace:

>Der polnische Ministerpräsident Donald Tusk bricht ein Wahlversprechen. Rund ein halbes Jahr nach seinem Amtsantritt dürfen Bergwerke immer noch unkontrolliert und legal ihre salzigen Abwasser in die Oder einleiten. Bestehende Genehmigungen wurden bisher nicht entsprechend verschärft. Die Folgen sind eindeutig und messbar – der Gehalt von Salz und Chlorophyll in der Oder ist in den vergangenen Wochen und Monaten stetig gestiegen. Die Kombination aus skrupellosen Konzernen und untätigen Behörden führt nach wie vor dazu, dass ein ganzer Fluss zunächst versalzt und dann vergiftet wird. Nur durch einen Stopp der Salzeinleitungen und eine entsprechende Überwachung durch polnische Behörden lässt sich verhindern, dass es zu weiteren ökologischen Katastrophen im polnisch-deutschen Fluss kommt.

1dje8l9,Ist das Renaturierungsgesetz der EU sinnvoll?,"Das neue Renaturierungsgesetz der EU, das im Februar 2024 verabschiedet wurde, zielt darauf ab, die Biodiversität zu fördern und beschädigte Ökosysteme in Europa wiederherzustellen. Zu den Hauptzielen gehört es, bis 2030 mindestens 20 Prozent der Land- und Meeresflächen zu renaturieren. Langfristig sollen bis 2050 fast alle bedrohten Lebensräume wiederhergestellt werden. Wichtige Maßnahmen umfassen die Renaturierung von Mooren, Flüssen und Wäldern sowie die Reduzierung destruktiver Fischereitechniken​.

# Vorteile des Renaturierungsgesetzes:

1. **Biodiversitätsschutz**: Das Gesetz trägt erheblich zur Erhaltung und Wiederherstellung der natürlichen Lebensräume bei, was langfristig den Artenreichtum in Europa fördert.
2. **Klimaschutz**: Renaturierte Ökosysteme wie Moore und Wälder können große Mengen an CO₂ speichern und somit zum Klimaschutz beitragen.
3. **Verbesserte Wasserqualität**: Die Wiederherstellung natürlicher Flussläufe und Feuchtgebiete trägt zur Verbesserung der Wasserqualität bei und sichert Trinkwasserreserven.
4. **Nachhaltige Landnutzung**: Das Gesetz fördert eine nachhaltigere Nutzung von Landflächen und unterstützt die landwirtschaftliche Produktion durch die Verbesserung von Bodenqualität und -struktur​ 

# Nachteile des Renaturierungsgesetzes:

1. **Bürokratie und Kosten**: Kritiker, insbesondere aus der Landwirtschaft und konservativen politischen Gruppen, bemängeln die zusätzliche Bürokratie und die hohen Kosten für die Umsetzung der Maßnahmen.
2. **Wirtschaftliche Auswirkungen**: Einige Landwirte befürchten negative Auswirkungen auf ihre Produktion und damit verbundene wirtschaftliche Einbußen, vornehmlich wenn landwirtschaftliche Flächen renaturiert werden müssen.
3. **Konflikte bei der Umsetzung**: Die praktische Umsetzung der Maßnahmen könnte zu Konflikten zwischen verschiedenen Interessengruppen führen, da die Landnutzung in Europa stark umkämpft ist​

Insgesamt wird das Renaturierungsgesetz als wichtiger Schritt zur Erreichung der EU-Ziele im Rahmen des Green Deal angesehen und hat das Potenzial, signifikante positive Auswirkungen auf die Umwelt und die Biodiversität in Europa zu haben. Die Herausforderung besteht jedoch darin, die Interessen der verschiedenen Stakeholder in Einklang zu bringen und die Maßnahmen effizient und kosteneffektiv umzusetzen.

1cbwwdy,Physikalisch maximal mögliche Leistung einer Windkraftanlage,"Ich habe einmal den maximal möglichen Ertrag einer Windkraftanlage in Abhängigkeit des Rotordurchmessers und der Windgeschwindigkeit grafisch dargestellt. Die entsprechende Formel lautet

P = 1/2 \* eta \* A \* rho \* v\^3

Hierbei ist eta der Wirkungsgrad, A die Rotorfläche, rho die Luftdichte und v die Windgeschwindigkeit.

Berücksichtigt wurde das Betzsche Gesetz, das einen maximal möglichen Wirkungsgrad von 59,26 vorhersagt. Außerdem wurde die Höhe der Windkraftanlage an den Rotordurchmesser angepasst und die Windgeschwindigkeit über ein bekanntes Exponentialgesetz mit einem Exponenten von 0,14  für die entsprechende Höhe ausgerechnet.

Zur Bestimmung der mittleren Leistung wurde über die gesamte Rotorfläche gemittelt (von 0,5\*R bis 2,5\*R als grobe Abschätzung).

Die Ergebnisse spiegeln somit ein oberes Limit wider. Höhere Erträge als ausgerechnet sind physikalisch nicht möglich. Die schwarzen Linien zeigen die entsprechenden Äquipotentiale auf.

**Beispiel:**

* Rotordurchmesser: 100 m
* Windgeschwindigkeit 50 km/h
* Maximal mögliche Leistung: 18,2 MW

1c3xrng,Wechsel vom Maschinenbau auf UmweltIng? Wie seht ihr das?,"Hallo zusammen,

ich überlege aus folgenden Gründen von Maschinenbau auf Umweltingenieurwesen zu wechseln. Es wäre für mich sehr wichtig, noch einmal die Meinung von Leuten zu hören, die eher dem grünen Spektrum angehören.

* Ich habe ein Fachgebiet wie FEM nicht wirklich als Leidenschaft entwickelt.
* Ich würde wirklich gerne die Ergebnisse meiner Arbeit sehen. Seien wir ehrlich, die meisten von den Maschinenbauern gehen wahrscheinlich in große Unternehmen, und dort ist man hauptberuflich mit sehr kleinen, iterativen Anpassungen von Komponenten oder Prozessen beschäftigt. Man arbeitet, um Teil der Entwicklungsgemeinschaft eines Produkts zu sein, nicht um es selbst zu bauen.
* Mit vielen unserer Produkte kann ich mich aufgrund veränderter politischer Einstellungen nicht mehr wirklich identifizieren. Die Entwicklung unserer Automobilindustrie hin zu immer größeren und protzigeren SUVs gefällt mir nicht. Alle Effizienzgewinne werden für mehr Blech für die Egos einiger Leute verschwendet. Ich habe auch den Eindruck, dass wir wahrscheinlich nie eine klimafreundliche Lösung für die Luftfahrt finden werden und dass es besser wäre, wenn es (wie bei den Autos) weniger davon gäbe. Wie soll ich da mit Stolz diese Produkte vertreten oder mich für das Wachstum dieser Branchen einsetzen?

Ich bin mir bewusst, dass es viele andere Branchen gibt, die davon unabhängig sind. Dazu gehören viele sehr einfache Produkte. Ein Freund von mir extrudiert zum Beispiel PVC. Vieles wird sich wahrscheinlich kaum mehr ändern, z.B. einfache Normteile. Die Bereiche sind ok, aber mich fasziniert diese Aussicht dort zu arbeiten schon lange nicht mehr.

Wenn es um erneuerbare Energien geht, gibt es natürlich allgemeine Studiengänge, die einen für Projektmanagement prädestinieren. Das kann man auch mit Geographie etc. machen, denn am Ende geht es um Genehmigungsverfahren und Ausschreibungen. Ich habe nicht den Eindruck, dass es hier an technischen Lösungen mangelt. Es fehlt an der politischen Umsetzung. Selbst wenn ich mich entscheiden würde, in die Windenergiebranche einzusteigen, wie wahrscheinlich ist das bei Unternehmen, die regelmäßig in Schwierigkeiten sind und an einer Hand abzählbar sind?

Entschuldigung für diese Negativität, aber ich bin ziemlich verzweifelt mit meiner Wahl dieses Bachelorstudiums (abgeschlossen). Hofft ihr immer noch auf die Möglichkeit einer ""Effizienzsteigerung"", die Maschinenbauer erreichen können? Die sehe ich im Maschinenbau nicht mehr wirklich.",7,7,2024-04-14 12:37:59,de,umwelt_de

Noch vor drei Jahren stimmte der niedersächsische Landtag mit großer Mehrheit gegen Erdgasbohrungen im Wattenmeer. Anfang 2022 hat die Landes-Regierung unter Ministerpräsident Weil und Wirtschaftsminister Lies eine 180-Grad-Wende gemacht: Vor Borkum soll nach Gas gebohrt werden, obwohl die Energiekrise abgewendet ist. Wir sprechen mit Karsten Smid vom Greenpeace Investigativ-Team, der mit unzähligen Anfragen an die Regierung der Frage nachgeht, welchen Einfluss die Gaslobby bei dieser Entscheidung hatte.

Nicht mit den Klimazielen vereinbar Die Rechtsanwältin Roda Verheyen erklärt, dass diese Bohrung rechtlich auf wackeligen Füßen steht, da sie den Klimazielen widerspricht. Ihr Rechtsgutachten zeigt, wer das Vorhaben stoppen könnte.

1ah085l,DUH Update zu Klimaschutzklagen vom 1.2.2024," 

### 1. Das Klimaschutzurteil des OVG Berlin Brandenburg vom 30.11.2023

Das Highlight im Jahr 2023 war ganz sicher das Urteil des Oberverwaltungsgerichts Berlin-Brandenburg am 30. November 2023 (mit den Aktenzeichen OVG 11 A 11/22 und OVG 11 A 27/22) als Auftakt zu insgesamt fünf Klagen gegen die Bundesregierung auf Einhaltung des Bundesklimaschutzgesetzes. Über zwei Jahre mussten wir auf die Gerichtsverhandlung warten. In den beiden DUH-Klagen ging es um die **Aufstellung und Umsetzung von Klimaschutz-Sofortprogrammen für die Sektoren Gebäude und Verkehr. Die Bundesregierung und allen voran Verkehrsminister Wissing und Bauministerin Geywitz weigerten sich, diese aufzustellen.**  


Allein im Verkehrsbereich klafft eine Lücke von 210 Millionen Tonnen CO2 bis 2030, aber FDP-Verkehrsminister Wissing möchte unbedingt verhindern, dass ausgerechnet er Maßnahmen wie ein Tempolimit auf Autobahnen, Tempo 80 außerorts und Tempo 30 in der Stadt ergreifen muss. Alleine mit dem Tempolimit ließe sich knapp ein Drittel der CO2-Einsparungsmenge bis 2030 erreichen. Die mehr als vierstündige Gerichtsverhandlung war eine Lehrstunde für den Klimaschutz und gleichzeitig für die Bedeutung zivilgesellschaftlichen Engagements.  


Neun Vertreter der Bundesregierung aus drei Ministerien, Verkehr (FDP), Bauen (SPD) und Klimaschutz (GRÜNE) kämpften verbissen dafür, keine weiteren Klimaschutzmaßnahmen in Sofortprogrammen festschreiben zu müssen. **Gemeinsam mit dem BUND, deren Klage mitverhandelt wurde, kämpften wir für die Einhaltung von Recht und Klimaschutzgesetz. Und unsere Argumente haben den Gerichtssenat überzeugt: Wir haben in allen Punkten Recht bekommen!**  


Das Oberverwaltungsgericht hat die Bundesregierung nun dazu verurteilt, Klimaschutzsofortprogramme zu aufzustellen, die geeignet sind, die CO2-Vorgaben des Klimaschutzgesetzes einzuhalten. **Und das Gericht hat bekräftigt: Klimaschutz-Sofortprogramme sind als Mechanismus im Klimaschutzgesetz vorgesehen, um bei einer Überschreitung der gesetzlichen jährlichen Emissionsobergrenzen effektiv nachzusteuern.** Diese Emissionsobergrenzen sind in den Sektoren Gebäude und Verkehr in den letzten Jahren wiederholt gerissen worden – im Jahr 2023 sage und schreibe zum vierten bzw. dritten Mal in Folge! Besonders peinlich für die Bundesregierung ist, dass ihr nun der vorsätzliche Verstoß beim Klimaschutz gerichtlich bescheinigt wurde – und das Urteil sicher nicht zufällig auf den Tag der Eröffnung der Weltklimakonferenz in Dubai gelegt wurde. Doch wird sie das Urteil akzeptieren und jetzt wie beschlossen „schnellstmöglich“ die beiden fehlenden Klimaschutz-Sofortprogramme beschließen?  


Bezeichnenderweise hat FDP-Verkehrsminister Volker Wissing einseitig angekündigt, gegen das Urteil in Revision zu gehen. Dabei kann eine solche Entscheidung nur von allen drei Regierungsparteien gemeinsam getroffen werden. SPD und GRÜNE behaupten uns gegenüber steif und fest, die Entscheidung erst nach Auswertung der (für diese Tage erwarteten) schriftlichen Urteilsbegründung treffen zu wollen. Hierzu fand am 8. Januar 2024 ein Gespräch mit dem zuständigen Staatssekretär Nimmermann im Bundeswirtschafts- und Klimaschutzministerium statt.  


Besonders ärgerlich ist der Widerstand der FDP-Minister. Wissing argumentiert offen mit der richtigen Schlussfolgerung, wenn dieses Urteil rechtskräftig würde, müsste er ein Tempolimit beschließen. Dieses will die FDP aber aus ideologischen und – ich sage mal – „mit Rücksichtnahme“ auf Porsche und andere Automobilhersteller, mit denen die Partei eng verbunden ist, unbedingt verhindern oder zumindest hinauszögern. **Wissing und Lindner setzen damit die Klimablockadepolitik der Vergangenheit fort. Wir sind aber selbst für den Fall, dass die Bundesregierung Revision einlegen wird, fest davon überzeugt, in diesem Verfahren vor dem Bundesverwaltungsgericht in Leipzig Erfolg zu haben.**

### 2. Klimaklagen gegen die Bundesregierung – Gerichtsverhandlung vor dem OVG Berlin-Brandenburg am 29. Februar und 16. Mai 2024

Darüber hinaus haben wir bereits im März 2020 eine Klage gegen die Bundesregierung aufgrund des zu hohen Ausstoßes von Luftschadstoffen in Deutschland eingereicht, die am 29. Februar endlich verhandelt wird. Im Rahmen der EU-Reduktionsverpflichtungen muss hierzulande bis 2030 unter anderem der Ausstoß von feinen Partikeln gesenkt werden. **Mit dieser laufenden Klage setzen wir die Bundesregierung unter Druck, wirksame Maßnahmen im Nationalen Luftreinhalteprogramm auf den Weg zu bringen, um klimaschädlichen Ruß und andere Luftschadstoffe drastisch zu mindern.** Notwendige Maßnahmen wie die verpflichtende wirksame Abgasreinigung bei Öfen würden die Rußpartikellast, die auch zur Erderhitzung führt, deutlich verringern. Dadurch erfüllen wir mit unserer Klage einen wichtigen Beitrag zum Gesundheitsschutz und zur Verringerung von immer noch bis zu 32.300 vorzeitigen Todesfällen pro Jahr durch Feinstaub in Deutschland. Darüber hinaus wird mit dieser Klage auch effektiv das Klima geschützt.  


Im Mai stehen auch schon weitere wichtige Verhandlungen am OVG Berlin-Brandenburg an (mit den Aktenzeichen OVG 11 A 22/20, OVG 11 A 31/22 und OVG 11 A 22/21): Eigentlich war unsere Verhandlung schon für heute, den 1. Februar angesetzt. Dieser Termin wurde wegen der Arbeitsbelastung des Gerichts nun auf den 16. Mai verschoben. Wir verklagen die Bundesregierung auf ausreichende Klimaschutzprogramme und **wollen damit erreichen, dass die Bundesregierung für alle Sektoren Programme aufstellt, mit denen die Ziele aus Klimaschutzgesetz auch langfristig erreicht werden. Dies ist eigentlich in Paragraph 9 des Klimaschutzgesetzes so festgeschrieben.** Aber wie auch schon bei den Klimaschutzsofortprogrammen müssen wir feststellen, dass es diese Bundesregierung nicht so ernst nimmt mit der Einhaltung ihrer eigenen Gesetze. Denn momentan sieht es leider düster aus: Bis 2030 werden laut Prognosen des Umweltbundesamtes bis zu 331 Millionen Tonnen CO2 zu viel ausgestoßen. Zum Vergleich: So viel CO2 stößt Österreich in 4 ½ Jahren insgesamt aus. **Diese riesige Klimaschuld ist in späteren Jahren fast unmöglich aufzuholen.** Ich will Ihnen das am Beispiel des Verkehrssektors kurz darstellen. Laut Klimaschutzgesetz darf der Verkehrssektor zwischen 2027 und 2030 insgesamt 398 Millionen Tonnen CO2 ausstoßen. Das heißt, selbst wenn in diesen Jahren im Verkehr theoretisch die gesamten CO2-Emissionen auf null gesetzt werden, würde das gerade einmal knapp ausreichen, damit wir wieder in die schwarzen Zahlen beim Klimaschutz rutschen. **Dafür dürften aber beispielsweise die knapp 46 Millionen Verbrenner-Pkw in Deutschland für mehr als drei Jahre keinen einzigen Zentimeter gefahren werden.**  


Diese prekäre Situation könnte die Regierung ganz leicht dadurch verhindern, dass sie jetzt endlich langfristig wirksame Maßnahmenprogramme aufstellt und umsetzt. Solche Programme müssten so **wichtige Maßnahmen enthalten wie ein Ausstiegsgesetz für fossile Heizungen, die Steigerung der Sanierungsrate im Gebäudebestand auf mindestens 3 Prozent, die Abschaffung der klimaschädlichen Subventionen, allen voran das Dienstwagenprivileg und das Dieselprivileg** (allein durch die Streichung dieser beiden Subventionen könnten bis zu 9,5 Millionen Tonnen CO2 pro Jahr eingespart werden), **eine fahrleistungsabhängige Pkw-Maut** (Einsparpotential: 12,6 Millionen Tonnen CO2 pro Jahr) **und selbstverständlich ein Tempolimit** (Einsparpotential: 11,1 Millionen Tonnen CO2 pro Jahr).  


Das Klimaschutzgesetz regelt eigentlich konkret genau diese langfristige Planung zur Erreichung der Klimaziele und schreibt vor, dass die Bundesregierung festlegen muss, „welche Maßnahmen sie zur Erreichung der nationalen Klimaschutzziele in den einzelnen Sektoren ergreifen wird“ (§ 9 (1) Klimaschutzgesetz). Aber das einzige, was diese Bundesregierung auf den Weg gebracht hat, ist das im Oktober 2023 beschlossene **„Klimaschutzprogramm 2023“. Dieses ist jedoch völlig unzureichend, um die Klimaziele auch tatsächlich zu erreichen. Selbst bei optimistischster Betrachtung verbleibt eine CO2-Lücke von 200 Millionen Tonnen bis 2030.** Der Expertenrat für Klimafragen, der von der Bundesregierung selber berufen wird und ein mit hoher Sachkompetenz ausgestattetes Gremium ist, hatte bereits im August, also zwei Monate vor dem Beschluss des „Klimaschutzprogramms 2023“, darauf hingewiesen, dass der Entwurf des Programms nicht die Anforderungen des Klimaschutzgesetzes erfüllt. Das war der Bundesregierung offensichtlich egal: Sie hat das Programm ohne wesentliche Änderung beschlossen.  
 

### 3. Neue Verfassungsbeschwerde gegen die Bundesregierung

Aus diesem Grund haben wir gleich nach dem Beschluss sondiert, wie wir dagegen vorgehen können. Wir haben beschlossen, **zusätzlich zu den bestehenden Klagen am OVG Berlin-Brandenburg eine Verfassungsbeschwerde gegen dieses Programm der Ambitionslosigkeit einzulegen**. Dank Ihrer tatkräftigen Unterstützung können wir so die Bundesregierung in den Zangengriff nehmen: Denn sie verstößt nicht nur gegen das Klimaschutzgesetz, sondern handelt darüber hinaus auch verfassungswidrig. Das Bundesverfassungsgericht hat nämlich in seinem historischen Klimabeschluss von 2021 das **Gebot des intertemporalen Freiheitsschutzes** etabliert. Das bedeutet vereinfacht gesagt, **dass notwendige Klimaschutzmaßnahmen nicht einfach in die Zukunft verschoben werden dürfen, weil dadurch die Gefahr steigt, dass später umso härtere Maßnahmen und Grundrechtseingriffe notwendig werden**. Das bedeutet zum Beispiel, wenn wir heute kein Tempolimit einführen – was ein sehr kleiner Grundrechtseingriff wäre – könnten später umso härtere Eingriffe nötig werden, um die notwendigen CO2-Einsparungen zu erreichen. Auch rigorose Maßnahmen wie komplette Fahrverbote sind dann denkbar. Das „Klimaschutzprogramm 2023“ macht aber genau dies und verschiebt die nötigen Klimaschutzmaßnahmen wie ein Tempolimit in die Zukunft. Darüber hinaus ist es derart vage und unbestimmt, dass völlig unklar bleibt, ob und wie viele Emissionen tatsächlich eingespart werden. Der einzige rote Faden des Klimaschutzprogramms – wenn man überhaupt von einem solchen sprechen möchte – ist, dass überall von „Förderungen“ und „Förderprogrammen“, von „Stärkungen“, „ausweiten“, „beschleunigen“, „voranbringen“, von „modernisieren“ und „Digitalisierung“ die Rede ist, ohne die konkreten Maßnahmen zu bezeichnen – und wann die beabsichtigte „Stärkung“, „Ausweitung“, „Beschleunigung“, „Modernisierung“ etc. denn überhaupt durchgeführt werden sollen.  


Mit unserer Verfassungsbeschwerde gegen das Klimaschutzprogramm wollen wir dafür sorgen, **dass der Staat auf einen grundrechtskonformen Klimaschutzkurs einschwenkt. Schon sehr bald könnte es dafür zu spät sein!**  
 

## Auch Unternehmen müssen endlich ihren Beitrag leisten

### 4. Unsere Klagen gegen BMW und Mercedes-Benz gehen vor den Bundesgerichtshof

Im September 2021 haben wir **Klagen gegen die beiden deutschen Autogiganten BMW und Mercedes-Benz** (Aktenzeichen: 3 O 12581/21 und 17 O 789/21) eingereicht, **um zu verhindern, dass sie weiterhin ungestört in einem Ausmaß wie sonst nur ganze Nationalstaaten für den CO2-Anstieg in der Atmosphäre sorgen**. Schon damals war uns klar, dass in dieser grundsätzlichen Rechtsfrage eine höchstrichterliche Entscheidung notwendig sein würde. Und so kommt es jetzt auch: Mit beiden Klagen sind wir mittlerweile vor dem Bundesgerichtshof. Vermutlich wird gleichzeitig auch eine ähnliche Klage, die Greenpeace gegen VW angestrengt hat, von den Bundesrichtern bearbeitet. Bereits in den unteren Instanzen vor den Landgerichten und Oberlandgerichten in München und Stuttgart haben die Richter sich teilweise vielversprechend in unsere Richtung geäußert, wenngleich die Klagen am Ende abgelehnt wurden. Zum Beispiel war es dem Richter am Landgericht München wichtig, darauf hinzuweisen, dass wir mit den Mitteln des Zivilrechts sehr wohl erreichen können, dass beide Unternehmen dazu verpflichtet werden, keine weiteren Verbrenner-Autos nach 2030 zu verkaufen. Er verwies darauf, dass das Bürgerliche Gesetzbuch ein sehr lebendiges Recht ist und er ohne weiteres Möglichkeiten finden könnte, unserem Anliegen mit den Mitteln des bürgerlichen Rechts gerecht zu werden. Für alle Gerichte war deswegen auch die Zulässigkeit unserer Klagen überhaupt nicht strittig.  


Dennoch wurden die Klagen abgelehnt. Das lag laut dem Richter daran – und ich möchte Ihnen das gerne weiterhin am Beispiel des Landgerichts München schildern –, dass zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt noch kein Anlass bestehe davon auszugehen, dass der Gesetzgeber dabei versagt, effektive Regelungen zur rechtzeitigen Erreichung der Treibhausgasneutralität im Verkehr zu finden. Wir sind vor dem Hintergrund des viel zu späten Verbrennerausstiegs, der noch dazu erhebliche Schlupflöcher offen lässt, und der schon heute bestehenden Klimalücke von hunderten von Millionen Tonnen CO2 selbstverständlich anderer Meinung. Wir werden vor dem Bundesgerichtshof nun für eine Einschätzung in unserem Sinne kämpfen. **Die Einschätzung des Münchner Richters zeigt nämlich auch, welches Potenzial unsere Klimaklagen gegen Unternehmen haben: Je länger der Staat wirksamen Klimaschutz verzögert, umso größer wird die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass Gerichte Unternehmen in Haftung nehmen werden.** Unsere Unternehmensklagen wachsen so in ihren Erfolg hinein.  
 

### 5. Unsere Klimaklagen gegen das Greenwashing der Unternehmen

Viele Unternehmen haben inzwischen die Zeichen der Zeit erkannt und setzen sich ernsthaft für Klimaschutz ein. Allerdings stellen wir immer wieder fest, dass mindestens genauso viele – und leider oft die großen – Unternehmen ausschließlich zu Werbezwecken auf diesen Zug aufspringen. **Anstatt jedoch ihre Kernprozesse und Geschäftsabläufe auf den Prüfstand zu stellen, werden über einen freien Kohlenstoffmarkt billige und höchst fragwürdige Emissionsgutschriften für Projekte in Schwellen- und Entwicklungsländern gekauft. Dafür dürfen sich die Unternehmen dann „klimaneutral“ nennen.**  


Ein Teil unserer Klimaklagen nimmt daher das Greenwashing ins Visier: Seit Mai 2022 gehen wir juristisch gegen irreführende Behauptungen von Unternehmen vor, die ihre Produkte, Dienstleistungen oder gleich ihr gesamtes Unternehmen als „klimaneutral“ bezeichnen. **Wir haben mittlerweile 43 Verfahren eingeleitet.** Über die Hälfte der Unternehmen haben sich gegenüber der DUH mit einer strafbewehrten Unterlassungserklärung dazu verpflichtet, Verbraucher zukünftig transparenter zu informieren. Drei Unternehmen wurde diese rechtswidrige Werbepraxis bereits gerichtlich untersagt, acht Verfahren sind aktuell noch gerichtsanhängig, weitere sechs Verfahren stehen kurz vor der Einleitung von Gerichtsverfahren.  


**Im April und Juni stehen zwei wichtige Gerichtsentscheidungen gegen die Mineralölriesen Shell Deutschland GmbH** (mit dem Aktenzeichen 315 O 108/22 und LG Hamburg) **und BP Europa SE** (mit dem Aktenzeichen 315 O 114/22, LG Hamburg) bevor: Shell behauptet, dass seine Kunden für einen Aufpreis von gerade einmal 1,1 Cent pro Liter Kraftstoff CO2-neutral fahren können. BP bewirbt Motorenöl als „Carbon neutral“. **Begründet wird dies mit dem Kauf solcher zweifelhaften Emissionsgutschriften – aus unserer Sicht ist das grob irreführend und massives Greenwashing.**  


Mit einer weiteren **Klage gegen den Touristikkonzern TUI Cruises** (mit dem Aktenzeichen 315 O 9/24, LG Hamburg) decken wir dagegen unrealistische Zukunftsversprechen auf: Der Kreuzfahrtriese verschafft sich mit dem Versprechen eines „dekarbonisierten Kreuzfahrtbetrieb\[s\]“ bis 2050 bereits heute ein **grünes Image, ohne tatsächlich konkrete Maßnahmen umzusetzen** oder einen Plan vorzulegen, wie dieses Ziel erreicht werden soll.  


Zum Abschluss möchte Ihnen gerne noch von einem großartigen Erfolg berichten, den wir am Verwaltungsgericht Schleswig errungen haben. Knapp neun Jahre nachdem wir durch eigene Abgasmessungen den Dieselskandal aufgedeckt haben, hat das Gericht in einem Urteil am 17. Januar (mit dem Aktenzeichen 3 A 332/20) **mehrere Abschalteinrichtungen bei Millionen von Diesel-Pkw des VW-Konzerns für unzulässig erklärt. Das Gericht hat festgehalten, dass die Abgasreinigung bei Diesel-Fahrzeugen zwischen minus 15 Grad Celsius und plus 40 Grad funktionieren muss.** Abschalteinrichtungen, die unter 10 Grad Außentemperatur, nach 15 Minuten Leerlauf oder oberhalb von 1.000 Metern Höhe die Reinigung der Abgase herunterfahren oder ganz abschalten, sind unzulässig. Damit bestätigte das Gericht sein Urteil vom Februar 2023 zu unserem Musterverfahren an einem VW Golf mit dem EA189-Motor. Neben diesen Fahrzeugen sind alle Dieselfahrzeuge der Abgasnorm Euro 5 bis Euro 6c aller Hersteller mit ähnlichen Abschalteinrichtungen ausgestattet, zu denen entsprechende Klagen eingereicht wurden. **Insgesamt rechnen wir damit, dass alleine in Deutschland noch rund 8,6 Millionen betroffene Dieselfahrzeuge im Betrieb sind. Die Stickoxide (NOx), um die es in diesem Verfahren geht, sind nicht nur eine große Gefahr für die Gesundheit, sondern haben zugleich ein sehr hohes Treibhauspotenzial.** Ein Verbot der Abschalteinrichtungen leistet deshalb gleichzeitig einen wichtigen Beitrag zum Klimaschutz.

> **Protest, um den Kleinbauern faire Preise zu garantieren, ist nicht das, was hier gerade passiert.**

> Der Bauernverband, der die Aufstände gerade orchestriert, vertritt Interessen, die den Bauern langfristig noch mehr Probleme machen. Und die Bauern lassen sich vor den Karren spannen, um sich selbst abzuschaffen und merken es nicht.

> Bauernverband und Industrie erstellen Vereine wie ""[Forum moderne Landwirtschaft](https://www.moderne-landwirtschaft.de/ueber-uns/)"" - im Vorstand der Bauernpräsident, im Aufsichtsrat Konzernvertreter von Bayer, Südzucker, BASF.

> Die Verbände vertreten die Interessen der Produzenten, nicht der Bauern. Ganz viel Filz in Richtung CxU.

> Der Bauernverband hat gemeinsam mit der Agrarindustrie große Versprechung gemacht und Hoffnung erweckt ""Wenn du fleißig bist, wenn du mitwächst, wenn du deine Stückkosten senkst, wenn du wettbewerbsfähig bist am Weltmarkt - dann wirst du überleben."" Und für viele Bauern - gerade für die Tierhalter - ist das nicht aufgegangen sonst hätten nicht so viele aufgehört in den letzten Jahren.

>""Wachsen oder weichen"" ist Agenda der Verbände.

> Parallel dazu wurden bundesweit 50+ neue Großställe gebaut oder geplant. Milchbetriebe, Rindermast, Schweine- vor allem Geflügelfarmen für insgesamt 3,3 Millionen Tiere. Die Durchschnittsgröße dieser Anlagen liegt in aller Regel weit oberhalb der Durchschnittsgröße, die wir in Deutschland schon haben. Das Fleisch wird zum Großteil exportiert, die Gülle und Umweltschäden bleiben hier.

> Das heißt, die Tierhaltung wandert von bäuerlichen Betrieben hin in die Hände von industriellen Tierhaltungen.

> Bauern dürfen auf ihren Flächen Grundwasser entnehmen, ohne dafür zu zahlen. [Will man das ändern](https://www.swr.de/swraktuell/rheinland-pfalz/ludwigshafen/wassercent-rheinland-pfalz-bauern-suedpfalz-zahlen-bald-grundwasser-100.html), laufen die Lobbygruppen sturm, weil es nur Betriebe betrifft, die mehr als **10 Millionen Liter Grundwasser** pro Jahr verbrauchen.

> Spannend bleibt es auch rund ums Agrarstrukturgesetz. Die Thüringer Landesregierung will damit den Verkauf von Ackerboden regeln und so die Landwirte vor Großinvestoren schützen. Der Thüringer Bauernverband lobbyiert **gegen** den Gesetzentwurf und will dagegen klagen, sollte es beschlossen werden.

> Die Bauernverbände & Agrarindustrie haben auch in den vergangenen Monaten praktisch alle aus ihrer Sicht drohenden Belastungen auf EU ebene verhindern können: Pestizideinschränkungen, Glyphosatverbot, mehr Naturflächen, Warnhinweise auf Weinflaschen - kommt alles ja so nicht.

> 75% der EU Subventionen gehen an 20% der Betriebe (die größten), bei den unteren 50% der Betriebe kommen nur 5% an. Die einzigen, die die Zuschüsse von der Größe entkoppeln wollten und z.b. Qualität oder andere Maßstäbe anführen wollten, waren DIE GRÜNEN, die aber natürlich an den Galgen gehören.

> Die Deutschen geben ungefähr 250 bis 300 Milliarden im Jahr - also zwischen 3 und 4000 € pro Nase - für Essen aus. Ist das jetzt ausreichend, um damit die paar Bauern, die es in Deutschland gibt, finanzieren zu können?

> Der Protest geht vollkommen in die falsche Richtung - bzw. die Verbände, die es lenken, lenken von sich selbst ab, weil sie eigentlich das Ziel sein sollten. Die Kleinbauern hätten Solidarität verdient, würden sie hier nicht das Falsche für die falschen Ziele tun.

> Aber die ganzen Bauern auf der Straße reden nicht gegen die industrielle Produktion sondern wollen ihren Betrieb erhalten. Die Verbände aber predigen weiterhin ""wachsen oder weichen"" und machen Politik für die Großabnehmer von Tierfutter und Pestiziden sowie Molkereien gegen die Interessen der Kleinbauern - während diese denken, ihre Verbände würden sie vertreten.

> Auftrag an alle Journalisten: Im Agrarausschuss sitzen Mitglieder des Bundestages, die Nebenerwerbe haben. Zum Teil Vorstandsvorsitzende von Molkereien o.ä.  Diese Unternehmen könnte man ja mal auflisten und dann mal gucken, wie viel Gewinne die machen und sich überlegen:  ""Ist hier wirklich zu wenig Geld im System? Kommt es auf die 21 Cent zurückerstattbarer Dieselsubvention an?"" Oder vielleicht einfach mal kurz die Liste der bilanzierungspflichtigen Unternehmen nehmen und stattdessen darüber schreiben?

> Hier in meinem 60k Wohnort gabs früher eine Molkerei für die ganzen Kleinbauern aus der Rhön, 25km weiter die Niederlassung für den Vogelsberg. Deren Milch gabs im Supermarkt. Lauterbacher Strolch (Camembert-artiger Käse) war über Jahrzehnte überregional bekannt und wurde nur in diesen Molkereien gefertigt. Inzwischen alles tot. Ähnliche ""Regionale"" Produkte aus der Rhön, entsprechend vermarktet und in lokalen Supermärkten hier auffindbar? Schwierig. Maximal in Hofläden, Dorfläden oder Metzgereien. Ansonsten das gleiche Angebot wie in Nord oder Süddeutschland. Tegut ist ne Ausnahme, aber die haben auch ihren Firmen-Hauptsitz hier. Und da ist der Kram halt generell auch etwas teurer. Die sind in den 40er als Handelsgemeinschaft gestartet, haben dann ne Fleischverarbeitung gegründet, den Rhöner Landwirten ihren Kram abgenommen. Ne Bäckerei gestartet. Inzw. von Migros übernommen.

Ich möchte heute eine spannende Entwicklung im Bereich nachhaltiger Baustoffe mit euch teilen. Forscher in Panama haben ein umweltfreundliches Dämmmaterial entwickelt, das auf Reisschalen und recyceltem Zeitungspapier basiert. Hier ein einfacher Überblick über diese Innovation:

&#x200B;

* **Hintergrund**: Der Bausektor ist der zweitgrößte Verbraucher von Kunststoff und verursacht über ein Drittel der energiebedingten Treibhausgasemissionen weltweit. Baustoffe aus agro-industriellem Abfall, wie dieses neue Material, sind daher wegen ihrer geringeren Umweltauswirkungen interessant​.
* **Die Innovation**: Das neue Dämmmaterial kombiniert Reisschalen und recyceltes Zeitungspapier. Es bietet eine wettbewerbsfähige Wärmeleitfähigkeit im Vergleich zu vielen natürlichen und recycelten Dämmstoffen​.
* **Herstellungsprozess**: Zur Herstellung des Materials wurden Reisschalen zerkleinert und mit Zellulose aus zerkleinertem Altpapier gemischt. Borax wurde hinzugefügt, um die Mischung pilzresistent und feuerhemmend zu machen. Alle Komponenten wurden mit Klebstoff gebunden. Die Forscher testeten verschiedene Materialzusammensetzungen, um das Verhalten des Materials bei unterschiedlichen Anteilen von Reisschalen zu überprüfen​.
* **Physikalische Eigenschaften**: Die Wärmeleitfähigkeit (k-Wert) des Materials lag zwischen 0,0409 und 0,04607 Watt pro Meter Kelvin, was für Isolationsmaterialien geeignet ist. Die Zugfestigkeit reichte von 1,31 bis 1,76 Megapascal, und die Druckfestigkeit lag zwischen 20,19 und 21,23 Megapascal, was die Verwendung des Materials im Bauwesen ermöglicht​.
* **Zukunftsperspektiven**: Weitere Forschungen sind notwendig, um die isolierenden Eigenschaften des Materials in unterschiedlichen Klimazonen zu bestätigen und seine Haltbarkeit zu bewerten. Zukünftige Studien könnten auch andere Konfigurationen einbeziehen, wie die Hinzufügung von langen Fasern, um das Material in Spannung zu verstärken. Es gibt Potenzial für den Einsatz in verschiedenen Ingenieurdisziplinen, einschließlich der Herstellung von Leichtbaukomponenten, Bauplatten und nachhaltigen Verpackungen​.

Für detailliertere Informationen empfehle ich den Artikel auf Tech Xplore: [Rice husk and recycled newspaper may be the eco-friendly insulation material of the future](https://techxplore.com/news/2023-11-rice-husk-recycled-newspaper-eco-friendly.html).

Lasst uns darüber diskutieren, wie solche Innovationen die Bauindustrie revolutionieren können!

186mpni,Vom Anden-Dorf bis zum Gericht: Ein Bauer gegen den Klimawandel-Riesen RWE," In einer bemerkenswerten Wendung im globalen Kampf gegen den Klimawandel verklagt Saúl Luciano Lliuya, ein Bauer aus den peruanischen Anden, den deutschen Energiekonzern RWE wegen seiner Rolle in der globalen Erwärmung. Luciano Lliuya, ein Mann mit indigenen Wurzeln, steht einem Unternehmen gegenüber, das fast ein halbes Prozent der weltweiten industriellen Treibhausgasemissionen verantwortet.

Sein Kampf hat ihn von den abgelegenen Höhen der Anden bis in die Gerichtssäle Deutschlands und zu internationalen Klimagipfeln geführt. Der Fall, der seit 2015 andauert, könnte Geschichte schreiben, indem er zeigt, dass auch entfernte Großemittenten für ihre Umweltauswirkungen zur Rechenschaft gezogen werden können. Der Prozess hat bereits einen finanziellen Einfluss auf RWE gezeigt und weckt ein breites Bewusstsein für die rechtlichen Risiken, die Unternehmen durch den Klimawandel drohen.

Luciano Lliuyas Motivation wurzelt tief in seinem persönlichen Erleben der Auswirkungen des Klimawandels. Er lebt in ständiger Bedrohung durch potenzielle Überschwemmungen infolge des Schmelzens der Andengletscher. Seine Klage basiert auf der Idee, dass der Klimawandel alle Menschen weltweit zu Nachbarn macht und daher große Verschmutzer wie RWE eine Verantwortung gegenüber Gemeinden wie der seinen tragen.

Dieser Fall spiegelt einen größeren Trend wider, in dem weltweite Klagen gegen fossile Brennstoffunternehmen eingereicht werden, die die Kosten ihrer Emissionen tragen sollen. Luciano Lliuyas Geschichte ist nicht nur ein juristisches Drama, sondern auch ein menschliches, das zeigt, wie Einzelpersonen und Gemeinschaften direkt von den Entscheidungen und Handlungen globaler Unternehmen betroffen sind.

👗🕰️ Im krassen Gegensatz dazu steht das nachhaltige Verhalten der Viktorianer: Sie fertigten, reparierten und recycelten ihre Kleidung mit Bedacht. Kleidung war damals wirtschaftlich und emotional wertvoller, und alte Stoffe fanden vielfältige Verwendung, sogar in der Papierherstellung.

Sollten wir uns ein Beispiel an ihrer Wertschätzung für Mode nehmen und die Idee des ""Weniger ist mehr"" neu entdecken?

1852s5h,"Über 60 Länder unterstützen Abkommen, um erneuerbare Energien in diesem Jahrzehnt zu verdreifachen","Eine beeindruckende globale Initiative nimmt Gestalt an: Mehr als 60  Länder, darunter wichtige Akteure der EU, USA und VAE, haben sich darauf  geeinigt, erneuerbare Energien in diesem Jahrzehnt zu verdreifachen und  von der Kohle wegzubewegen.

Diese historische Vereinbarung wird eine Schlüsselrolle in den bevorstehenden COP28-Klimaverhandlungen in Dubai spielen. Länder wie Nigeria, Südafrika, Vietnam, Australien, Japan, Kanada und viele andere haben ihre Unterstützung für das Abkommen zugesagt. Es beinhaltet auch das Ziel, die weltweite jährliche Energieeffizienz bis 2030 auf 4 % zu verdoppeln und die Finanzierung neuer Kohlekraftwerke zu beenden.

Die Bemühungen, China und Indien für dieses Abkommen zu gewinnen, sind ebenfalls weit fortgeschritten. Wissenschaftler betonen, dass die rasche Ausweitung sauberer Energien und die Reduzierung fossiler Brennstoffe im Energiesektor entscheidend sind, um schwerwiegendere Klimaveränderungen zu vermeiden.

Die frühzeitige Unterstützung dieses Ziels wird als wichtiger Schritt gesehen, um Schwung für die anstehenden, intensiven Verhandlungen auf der Klimakonferenz zu schaffen.

1854wqo,Drei positive Entwicklungen im Klimaschutz," Es gibt Hoffnungsschimmer im Kampf gegen den Klimawandel:

1. **Verbesserte Klimaprojektionen seit dem Pariser Abkommen**: Obwohl die globalen Emissionen immer noch zu hoch sind, haben die Bemühungen der Länder seit dem Pariser Abkommen 2015 dazu geführt, dass die erwartete Erwärmung bis 2100 von 3,5 °C auf 2,5 °C bis 2,9 °C gesunken ist. Das zeigt, dass Fortschritte möglich sind​.
2. **Verlangsamung des Emissionsanstiegs**: Die jährlichen Treibhausgasemissionen sind seit der COP21 um etwa 9 % gestiegen, aber die Rate dieses Anstiegs hat sich deutlich verlangsamt. Aktuelle Schätzungen deuten darauf hin, dass die globalen Emissionen bis 2024 oder sogar noch in diesem Jahr ihren Höhepunkt erreichen könnten.
3. **Zunahme erneuerbarer Energien und Elektrofahrzeuge**: Solar- und Windenergie sowie Elektrofahrzeuge tragen wesentlich zur verbesserten Klimaprojektion bei. Es wird erwartet, dass diese Technologien bis 2030 rund 15 % der weltweiten Stromproduktion ausmachen werden, was siebenmal mehr Windkraft und dreimal mehr Photovoltaik als 2015 vorhergesagt ist. Außerdem hat der Verkauf von Elektrofahrzeugen in den vergangenen zwei Jahren deutlich zugenommen​.

**Diskussion:** Wie können wir diese positiven Trends weiter fördern und was könnten die nächsten Schritte sein, um den Klimawandel wirksam zu bekämpfen?

ich habe mich gefragt, welchen Einfluss die aktuelle Nachhaltigkeitsberichterstattung auf das Investorenverhalten hat. Im Rahmen der EU Taxonomie und der damit eingebetteten CSRD Richtlinie müssen Unternehmen ja gewisse Kennzahlen und Aktivitäten offenlegen.

Gerade mit dem Hintergedanken der ""Wallstreetbets/ Mauerstraßenwetten"" hat sich ja gezeigt, welchen großen Einfluss auch Kleinanleger in ihrer Masse am Kapitalmarkt haben können.

Hat Nachhaltigkeit für euch irgendeine Art von Einfluss auf eure Investitionen oder ist euch die dabei egal?

Wenn ihr dazu meine kurze Umfrage für meine Bachelorarbeit ausfüllen könntet, wäre ich euch zutiefst verbunden!

Sind Altreifen in der Natur eine Gefahr für das Grundwasser/Umwelt oder nicht. Und ja, die Teile sollten nicht in die Natur gekippt werden. Aber mich stört das ich manchmal darauf hingewiesen werde das eigentlich keine Gefahr von denen ausgeht - da die knapp 2000 Jahre brauchen bis sie sich zersetzen. Oder das darauf hingewiesen wird das diese eine Gefahr für das Grundwasser sein sollen. Nur ohne Hinweis was da ins Wasser kommt.

Oder es gibt Artikel wo beides gesagt wird: [https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/swr/autoreifen-entsorgung-101.html](https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/swr/autoreifen-entsorgung-101.html)

&#x200B;

Weis hier jemand was die Gefahr bei Altreifen ist? Viele Reifen haben ja heute Plaste als Bestandteil. Ist es das? Also die selben Giftstoffe wie Plastik? Oder sind die geschwefelten Kautschukbestandteile doch das Problem? Aber bei der zerfallrate - kommt da überhaupt viel hinaus in die Umwelt?

Und ja, es ist eine triviale Frage aber es treibt mich ein wenig in den Wahnsinn. WAS ist an den Altreifen so giftig? Und was wäre mit den ollen Kautschukreifen von Damals? Was wenn die jemand wegwerfen würde. Wäre das auch ein Problem. Ist das nur ein Problem durch unsere modernen Mischungen? Ich frage weil man vielleicht das giftige weg lassen könnte.

Weis jemand was? Ich wäre wirklich wirklich happy wenn ich endlich wissen würde was da giftig ist und vielleicht sogar wie viel da raus kommt. Wie gefährlich ist so ein Autoreifen für die Umwelt und das Grundwasser.",2,16,2023-10-03 15:53:23,de,umwelt_de

Da liege ich mit fast 8t natürlich drüber aber es gibt zum Glück auch Verbesserungspotential.

Ich habe auch mal nachgeschaut, wie viel CO2 ein Mensch im Jahr durchs Atmen ausstößt und jetzt bin ich verwirrt. Es sind wohl bis zu 2t, heißt das man kann mit etwas Sport das Budget von 1,5t alleine durchs Atmen verbrauchen? Ich finde das irgendwie krass.",18,101,2023-09-07 05:31:47,de,umwelt_de

16bxyjp,Wasser als politisches Druckmittel in Zeiten von Klimakrise?,"Guten Abend,

Ich habe im laufe eines Referates mich näher mit den Auswirkungen von Staudämmen  beschäftigt. In der Türkei wurden mehrere Staudämme am Euphrat und Tegris gebaut, welche starke Auswirkungen in der Region haben. Neben der Energiegewinnung wurden noch politische Intentionen kritisiert, dass die türkische Regierung Wasser als Druckmittel nutzt. Die irakische und syrische Landschaft, am Euphrat und Tigris und dessen Abzweigungen, wurden stark eingeschränkt, sodass bereits nebenflüsse austrockneten. 

Es wird sicherlich ähnliche Beispiele mit anderen Methoden geben. Das Resultat ist aber die Zerstörung des Ökosystem in einer (künftigen) Hitzeregion. Je extremer das Wetter und je knapper das Wasser wird, desto eher steigt das Risiko eines Konfliktes.

Der Post dient nur zur Wahrnehmung des Problemes und hoffentlich einem Denkanstoß in die richtige Richtung.

&#x200B;

Entschuldigung, wenn dies nicht der richtige Ort ist, um diese Frage zu stellen. Aber dies ist einer der letzten Orte, an denen ich möglicherweise eine Antwort bekommen könnte.

&#x200B;

Soweit ich weiß, benötigen alle Produkte in Europa eine EPD. Ich habe nachgeschaut und festgestellt, dass die meisten großen Unternehmen die EPDs für ihre Produkte auf ihrer Website zum Herunterladen bereithalten. Es gibt auch einige Websites wie (environdec), wo man EPDs nachschlagen und herunterladen kann.

&#x200B;

14u6ewj,"Letzte Chance, das Renaturierungsgesetz im EU-Parlament zu retten"," Eigentlich war es eine relativ sichere Abstimmung im EU-Parlament.  Das Renaturierungsgesetz sieht unter anderem vor, mindestens 20 %  geschädigter Land- und Wasserflächen bis 2030 in Europa wieder  herzustellen. 

Auch der Moor- und Waldschutz soll in dem Gesetzesentwurf gestärkt werden. [Der NABU hat es gut zusammengefasst.](https://www.nabu.de/natur-und-landschaft/naturschutz/europa/33254.html) 

Ratspräsidentin Ursula von der Leyen hat das Gesetz selbst initiiert,  weshalb die Zustimmung der konservativen Fraktion EPP, die auch die CDU  / CSU angehört, als wahrscheinlich galt. 

Aber wie es derzeit so ist, alles, was irgendwie mit Umweltschutz zu  tun hat, wird zum Feindbild erklärt. Im Zusammenschluss mit rechten  Parteien haben die Liberalen und Christdemokraten enorm gegen das Gesetz  Stimmung gemacht. Mit über 50 Änderungsanträgen soll die Abstimmung am  Mittwoch sabotiert und extrem verwässert werden. 

Da nicht ganz  klar ist, wie einzelne Abgeordnete sich letztendlich entscheiden und die  Mehrheiten hauchdünn sind, macht öffentlicher Protest aus meiner Sicht  diesmal mehr Sinn als bei manch anderen Themen.

## Was tun?

Die Fraktion „THE GREENS/EFA“ haben ein Tool gebastelt, das eine Mail  an Kritiker und Gegner des Gesetzes sendet, um sie noch umzustimmen: [Zum Tool](https://act.greens-efa.eu/de/restore-nature). 

Ich habe die **Protestpostkarte** zur GAP Reform  umgetextet und es wäre geil, wenn wir noch eine ordentliche Anzahl an  Protestpostkarten an die Abgeordneten senden könnten. 

Dafür müsst ihr bis spätestens Montag, 10.07. 12:00 Uhr bestellen.  Dann müsste die Postkarte bis Dienstag, spätestens Mittwoch in Brüssel  ankommen. 

Ich habe sie zum Selbstkostenpreis (ja, ist leider echt so teuer dank  Material, PayPal, Porto, Mehrwertsteuer) für 1,99€ eingestellt. [Hier Protestpostkarte bestellen.](https://postkartenprotest.de/produkt/gap-agrarpolitik/)

Natürlich kann man auch noch selbst einen Brief, eine Postkarte oder eine Email an die Abgeordneten senden. [Alle Abgeordneten findet man hier](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/de/full-list/all).",16,0,2023-07-08 10:58:33,de,umwelt_de

Mein Gedanke ist: Das CO2, das jetzt noch im Boden gespeichert ist jetzt in die Atmosphäre kommt, war vor Millionen von Jahren schon in der Atmosphäre, bevor es durch Photosynthese gebunden und nach Absterben der Pflanzen etc. in den Erdschichten zu fossilen Brennstoffen wurde.
Das heißt, das „zusätzliche“ CO2, das jetzt in die Atmosphäre gelangt ist im Prinzip altes CO2, das jetzt zurück in die Kreisläufe kommt. Warum ist das problematisch für das Klima? Dadurch werden doch lediglich prähistorische CO2 Level wiederhergestellt.
Vielleicht habe ich auch was übersehen, der Gedanke ist mir gerade einfach gekommen… Thx für die Aufklärung :)",1,6,2023-07-01 17:25:51,de,umwelt_de

14i7xkd,"Die Zeit der CDs war eigentlich schön. Die Kritiker der Plattenindustrie, dass sie ja unnötig Plastik durch die Welt transportiere, haben den Rebound-Effekt des Streamings nicht bedacht","Unmengen an Daten vom Videostreamen erzeugen bei den Servern CO2-Ausstoß. Selbst wenn Musik nur im Hintergrund läuft, ist der ganze Videofeed von YouTube trotzdem da. Aber selbst mit Spotify oder Soundcloud, man kann zwar viele neue Stücke finden, aber irgendwann hat man seinen Musikgeschmack gefunden und hört sich dasselbe Lied oder dasselbe Album ganz oft an. Wenn man das dann nicht irgendwie lokal gecached hat, was ja dem Modell der Cloud widerspricht, muss man dasselbe Lieblingslied also ganz oft runterladen, anstatt es einmal physisch da zu haben.

Vielleicht liege ich falsch und das CO2-technische Optimum unter Abwägung der Verfügbarkeit war das Downloading-Zeitalter mit riesigen Festplatten voller mp3. Aber das Streaming-Zeitalter ist es bestimmt nicht.

Habe mir gestern nach langer Zeit mal wieder einen CD-Player gekauft, der auch mp3 abspielen kann. Wenn ich damit meinen YouTube-Musikkonsum herunterfahre, sehe ich das als Gewinn.

Ich habe gelernt, dass die Baumhummel höhere Plätze mag. Wie sieht's mit Sonne aus? Der Kasten kriegt derzeit volle Lotte die Sonne ab und die Hummeln sind ordentlich am durchlüften. Vielleicht setze ich die ein bisschen mehr in den Schatten? 

Thema Uhrzeit: Die Kollegen gehen nachts pennen, oder? Also am besten Nachts umsetzen? 

Weitere Tipps?

124nn1w,Warum finden einige die Ausnahme für Klimaneutrale synthetische Kraftstoffe schlecht?,"Wer nicht hinter dem Mond lebt, hat ja mitbekommen, dass nun endgültig ein Gesetz verabschiedet wurde das bestimmt, dass ab 2035 Uhr keine Neuwagen mehr zugelassen werden dürfen die mit Benzin oder Diesel fahren.

Weiterhin dürfen Verbrenner zugelassen werden, die mit klimaneutralen synthetischen Kraftstoffen fahren. 

Ich lese online sehr viele Kommentare, dass das schlecht sei und Volker Wissing ein weiterer Verkehrsminister ist der in seinem Job versagt hat. 

Kann mir jemand mal erklären, warum? Als einzige Begründung ist immer genannt, dass es deutlich mehr Energie kostet den Kraftstoff zu produzieren, als ihn direkt über eine Batterie zum Betreiben des Autos zu nutzen.  

Aber mein erster Gedanke ist immer, dass das doch gar kein Problem ist. Wir haben ja erst mal keinen Energiemangel, sondern ein Stromspeicher und -transport Problem. 

- Windstrom wird vor allem in der Nordsee erzeugt und wir haben schon Probleme den Strom in den Süden zu bekommen.
- Solarzellen erzeugen den Strom Mittags, die Menschen möchten ihre Autos aber gerne nachts laden.

Wenn synthetischer Kraftstoff dann erzeugt werden kann, wenn der Strom da ist und dort wo er günstig ist, bleibt doch lediglich das Transportsystem.

Wenn irgendwo in Nordafrika der Strom mit PV-Anlagen produziert werden kann, ist es ja erstmal egal ob es die dreifache Menge braucht oder nicht? Dann ist das Problem lediglich der CO2 Ausstoß beim Transport zu den Tankstellen.

Und dann ist es egal wann der Strom produziert werden kann, weil die Kraftstoffe tanken kann man immer. 

Auch wenn irgendwann der Individualverkehr nur carsharing Autos bestehen sollte, ergänzt sich das ganze doch auch super. Je nach Verfügbarkeit des Stroms, wähle ich eben ein Carsharing Auto mit E-fuel oder einen Stromer.

Habe ich da einen Denkfehler oder warum finde ich das nirgends? Ich bin im Allgemeinen eh gegen das Gesetz dem Ausschuss, aber vielleicht können Sie mich überzeugen, warum es sinnlos ist die klimaneutralen Kraftstoffe auszuschließen, ich will nur verstehen. Wir müssen uns da nicht auf eine Meinung einigen.

Ich sehe folgende Probleme beim Gesetz: 
- Ladeinfrastruktur in Städten mit Mehrfamilienhäusern
- woher der ganze Strom kommen soll
- Überlastung der Netze bei Nacht
- Rohstoffverfügbarkeit (Batterien)
- Von anderen Ländern in der EU fangen wir gar nicht mal an zu reden, ich werde ja nie nach Rumänien oder Bulgarien oder außerhalb der EU in den Urlaub fahren können, da ich das Auto da nicht laden kann

Die Ladezeit von den Autos sehe ich nicht großes Problem, 20 Minuten für das Laden warten zu müssen, kann man den Menschen für deutlich besseren Klimaschutz schon zumuten.

Wie sollen wir eine gute Infrastruktur für so viele Elektroautos schaffen können, wenn wir den Deutschlandtakt um 40 Jahre auf 2070 verschieben müssen?

Ich würde mich freuen, wenn ihr mir eure Gedanken so erklären könntet, dass ich sie verstehe und nachvollziehen kann. Diese Frage habe ich schon länger und ich konnte sie mir selber einfach nicht erklären, daher wollte ich euch einfach fragen.

Und bitte beachtet, dass es hier nicht um die Abschaffung von Individualverkehr gehen soll.

Sorry für den langen Text

Story: Nachbarschaftskrieg. Wir haben hier immer wieder von einer Partei Besucher auf unseren Parkplätzen und nach prüfen aller rechtlichen Mittel könnten wir ihn abschleppen lassen. Allerdings müsste das meine Vermieterin tun. Nach einem ausgiebigen Gespräch mit meinem Anwalt ist das einzige was ich direkt und ohne Folgen machen kann, seine Scheiben temporär zu bemalen. Das wäre aber nur ohne Folgen für mich wenn dies sehr sehr leicht und schnell zu entfernen wäre. Dadurch kommt ein Whiteboard-Marker leider nicht in frage. Jetzt hab ich an Kreide-Marker gedacht und suche welche die wirklich sehr leicht zu entfernen sind damit er sich zwar des Todes aufregt aber ich keinen bleibenden oder Zeit aufbringenden Schaden verursache.

Hier  gibt es viele Möglichkeiten: Smarte Thermostate, Isolierung oder  einfach die Heizung runter drehen und einen Pulli anziehen.

Da  man nie wirklich weiß, was jetzt genau wie viel bringt im eigenen  Haushalt, haben mein Mitbewohner und ich uns zu einem Projekt an der Uni  angemeldet (KIT). Hier wollen wir eine App und einen Sensor entwickeln,  um genau vorraussagen zu können, welche Investition (Isolierung,  Thermostate etc..) oder welches Verhalten (wann lüften, wie stark die  Heizung aufdrehen etc..) Geld sparen und wie viel.

Im  Rahmen dieses Projektes müssen wir eine Umfrage machen. Wir würden uns  sehr freuen, wenn ihr daran teilnehmt. Die Umfrage dauert etwa 3-4  Minuten.

10ihfgu,Wie sieht die Zukunft der Braunkohlelöcher aus?,"Hallo liebe Freunde unseres blauen Planeten!

Ich stelle mir seit Jahren die Frage, wie die Zukunft der Braunkohlelöcher aussehen soll. Die diversen Konzepte von RWE und der LEAG habe ich mir alle durchgelesen. Bei der LEAG kann man auch die ersten Versuche der ""Renaturierung"" begutachten. Das Allheilmittel war bisher immer die Auffüllung mit gigantischen Wassermassen und das Umwandeln in ein ""touristisches Naturparadies"". Diese Umwandlung hat bisher wenig Früchte getragen und die touristische Entwicklung der Löcher ist eher ernüchternd. Bei der LEAG kommt es alljährlich zu massiven Erdrutschen und Umweltzerstörungen durch die ""Renaturierung"". Durch das Abpumpen von Wasserbeständen aus der Region in die ""Seen"" kommt es zudem vermehrt zu Wasserknappheit.

Was den Tourismus angeht, war ich schon immer extrem skeptisch. Der Fremdenverkehr lebt i.d.R. von einzigartigen Naturlandschaften und nicht von künstlich erschaffenen Forstanlagen. Zumal selbst die Lausitz oder Terhills in Beligen immer noch wie eine Landschaft aus dem Reagenzglas aussehen. Im Falle der LEAG verbleibt das Gebiet auch im Eigentum der Gesellschaft, sodass eine Ansiedlung von Gastronomie, Hotels oder Ferienwohnungen auf dem Gelände nahezu unmöglich ist. Ich gewinne auch zunehmend den Eindruck, dass die LEAG vom Tourismus langsam abstand nimmt und eher die Nutzung für erneuerbare Energie ins Auge fasst.

Für beide Löcher in NRW (Garzweiler/Hambach) plant die RWE exakt das gleiche Vorgehen und möchte den größten See Deutschlands errichten. Dazu werden mutmßalich Milliarden Liter Wasser aus den naheliegenden Flüssen, insbesondere dem Rhein, abgepumpt. Der Rhein hat schon heute große Probleme mit Dürre und Austrockung, sodass überhaupt zweifelhaft ist, ob so viel Wasser abgepumpt werden kann ohne den Fluss komplett auszutrocknen.

Der BUND stellt die ""Renaturierung"" ganz grundsätzlich in Frage und bekommt von RWE den Vorwurf, man würde das Loch einfach liegen lassen wollen. Das hat mich persönlich sehr stutzig gemacht und ich frage mich, ob da nicht vielleicht etwas dran ist. Bevor noch weitere Umweltschäden durch ""Renaturierung"" verursacht und irgendwelche hahnebüchenden Tourismusphantasien verfolgt werden, macht es nicht vielleicht mehr Sinn das Loch einfach der Natur zu überlassen?

Ich habe bisher überhaupt keine ökologisch und ökonomisch nachhaltigen Konzepte gesehen, die eine sinnvolle Nachnutzung der Tagebaulöcher zulassen. Das einzig sinnvolle Vorgehen erscheint mir bis heute: das Loch einfach liegen lassen und hoffen, dass unser Planet es schafft, diese Wunde irgendwie selbst zu heilen.

Wie seht Ihr die Zukunft der Braunkohlelöcher?

Liebe Grüße aus NRW,

1fg41f6,"16,2 millions de logements risquent de se fissurer, cette région de France est particulièrement touchée","Les propriétaires ne le savent pas, mais 16,2 millions de logements risquent de se fissurer. Une région française est particulièrement touchée par ce phénomène.

La situation a fortement empiré en l'espace de quelques années et le phénomène continue de prendre de l'ampleur. De plus en plus de logements en France sont en danger. Pour les propriétaires comme pour les locataires, les conséquences sont désastreuses : les millions de maisons et d'appartements concernés pourraient devenir inhabitables et donc inlouables et invendables.

Ce phénomène inquiétant est directement lié au réchauffement climatique. Il s'agit du retrait-gonflement des argiles (RGA). En clair, avec les sécheresses, le sol argileux se rétracte, entraînant un affaissement des fondations. À l'inverse, lorsque les pluies reviennent, le sol gonfle, provoquant une remontée des fondations. Ces mouvements répétés engendrent des fissures béantes sur les murs des habitations.

Or, le RGA survient massivement au moment de la rentrée, alors que les températures estivales chutent et que les pluies d'automne se préparent. La période actuelle est donc propice aux fissures. Selon un recensement effectué par le ministère de la Transition écologique en 2021, pas moins de 10,4 millions de bâtiments en France étaient directement menacés par la fragilisation et les fissures. Dans le détail, plus d'une maison sur deux (54,2%) étaient susceptibles d'être impactées par le RGA. La situation est encore pire aujourd'hui, notamment dans une région française en particulier.

L'association Conséquences, qui se penche sur les impacts du changement climatique, alerte sur l'aggravation future du phénomène. ""Les données des quarante dernières années montrent une tendance permanente à la hausse des maisons fissurées. Les projections pour les années et décennies à venir vont dans le sens d'un accroissement exponentiel de la situation"" indique l'association dans un récent rapport.

L'Observatoire de l'immobilier durable confirme ces prévisions inquiétantes. D'ici 2050, ce ne sont plus la moitié, mais les deux tiers des maisons qui seront concernées par le risque de fissuration. Au total, le nombre de logements (maisons et appartements confondus) menacés passera à 16,2 millions.

**Certaines régions françaises sont plus exposées que d'autres au phénomène du RGA. Plus de 20 millions de Français vivent dans des zones à risque moyen ou fort. La région Centre-Val de Loire est la plus touchée, avec 67% des maisons concernées. Suivent l'Occitanie (49%), la Nouvelle-Aquitaine (47%), la Bourgogne-Franche-Comté (44%) et la région Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (39%).**

Le coût des réparations pour les habitations fissurées peut s'avérer considérable, allant jusqu'à plusieurs centaines de milliers d'euros. La prise en charge du RGA pourrait peser 2,1 milliards d'euros par an dans les années à venir, contre 700 millions actuellement. Consolider l'ensemble des maisons à risque représenterait un coût annuel pouvant atteindre sept milliards d'euros.

C'est un enfer que vivent ces animaux tous les jours, au milieu de conditions inhumaines.

Des faits indéniables ont été révélés, parmi lesquels des traitements inacceptables envers ces bêtes. C'est une pratique qui ne peut pas continuer ainsi. Ce n'est pas seulement problématique d'un point de vue éthique, mais il y a aussi un danger sanitaire clair à la suite de ces conditions négligées.

Nous ne pouvons pas continuer à tourner le dos. Pour la dignité et le bien-être des animaux, nous exigeons la fermeture de cet abattoir à Boulogne sur Gesse 31350. Une enquête doit être ouverte pour permettre de faire la lumière sur ces pratiques atroces.

Nous vous demandons, en tant que représentants du peuple, d'écouter nos voix et de prendre des mesures pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains. Merci d'ajouter votre voix à la nôtre. S'il vous plaît, signez cette pétition.

Salut tout le monde !
Voilà, je suis diplômée de master en informatique en quête de sens (comme beaucoup ici).

Voilà quelque temps que j'essaie de trouver un projet qui me permet de mettre mes connaissances au service de mes convictions.

Or voilà l'idée : je suis un enthousiaste du vélotouriste et je commence à avoir pas mal roulé ma bosse (Irlande, Bretagne, pays de la Loire, pays bas, alsace, suisse, Italie, Autriche, ...)

Ce mode de tourisme faible en carbone est devenu un incontournable des vacances dans la famille, mes parents ne font plus que ça et l'idée même de visiter un pays en voiture nous semble aujourd'hui complètement absurde. 

Mais voilà, malgré une certaine volonté de l'Europe, choisir ce mode de transport reste aujourd'hui très hasardeux. Les routes (même vélo route) peuvent être dangereuses, ou inintéressant sur des kilomètres. Les transports en commun comme les bus ou les trains peuvent ne pas prendre les vélo et vous obliger à les abandonner, ...
J'ai une liste de galère longue comme le bras. Bien sûr, on finis par s'y habituer, connaître les astuces et finir toujours pas s'en sortir pour faire un voyage mémorable, mais c'est un sacré repoussoir pour les gens qui s'y essaie pour la première fois.

Et les guides sont à chier. Si le guide  du routard était il y a 50 ans un excellent guide pratique pour les marcheurs à pied. Aujourd'hui ils ne se fatiguent pas et prennent leur voiture.

Donc le projet, c'est tout d'abord de faire une application Android (+apple +site web si possible)
Permettant aux vélos-touristesde partager leur carnet de bord (route prise, étape intéressante, photo, avis sur la sécurité de la route, son intérêt, avis sur les transports : comment sont les bus, les trains pour les vélos, est-ce facile de faire du bivouac, le prix des campings pour les cyclistes, etc)

À partir de ces informations on calcule et on propose des itinéraires adaptés aux autres cyclistes et à leur condition de voyage (jeunes enfants par ex)


D'un point de vu économique, ce qui serait bien c'est de faire ensuite des tirages papier, des livres de voyage genre du routard (ils commencent à le faire mais sont relativement nul dans le sens où il donne juste des avis sur des portions de voies déjà très connues genre Loire à vélo), et des cartes.

L'idée c'est de refaire des guides pour les routards, bas carbone, bas budget

Voilà voilà
Le souci c'est que même si j'ai une formation d'informaticien et que je maîtrise pas mal de langue de prog, j'ai ... Euh ... jamais fait de dvp d'application 😅. 
Donc j'aimerais savoir si certains d'entre vous ont des conseils à me donner pour me mettre sur les bons rails (ou même plus rejoindre l'aventure)",9,8,2024-09-04 03:57:36,fr,ecologie

Je me demandais s'il y avait des projets d'ingénierie économique (pas ceux qui passent par des taxes), et s'il y avait eu des travaux pour les évaluer. 

Une idée qui me trotte dans la tête c'est d'acheter du pétrole et de le stocker à très long terme : on ""bloque"" ainsi le carbone qui serait relaché en le brûlant, et en même temps c'est un investissement sur l'avenir puisque on peut imaginer qu'il reste revendable beaucoup plus tard. Évidemment ça demande beaucoup de capitaux, mais vu que ça devrait faire augmenter les prix du pétrole, ça pourrait être un bon moyen d'action contre les émissions de CO2.

J'imagine qu'on peut faire la même chose avec des mines, en les achetant pour ne pas les exploiter.

Je n'ai rien trouvé concernant ce genre d'idees, mais peut-être que je n'ai pas les bon termes. En tout cas si il y a eu des simulations ou estimations, je suis intéressé.",6,34,2024-08-31 14:08:01,fr,ecologie

1f3b6uk,L’IA d’Elon Musk accusée d’aggraver la pollution de particules fines à Memphis avec des turbines à gaz non autorisées dans un datacenter,"La startup d'intelligence artificielle d'Elon Musk, xAI, est accusée par des défenseurs de l'environnement et de la santé de contribuer au problème de pollution à Memphis, Tennessee, en utilisant des turbines à gaz naturel dans son nouveau centre de données, et ce, sans permis.

L'entreprise a déclaré qu'elle ouvrait le centre de données en juin dans une ancienne usine Electrolux, peu après avoir annoncé qu'elle avait levé 6 milliards de dollars pour une valorisation de 24 milliards de dollars. Dans un post sur X le mois dernier, Musk s'est vanté que xAI avait commencé à entraîner ses modèles d'IA dans l'installation en utilisant 100 000 processeurs H100 de Nvidia.

Le Southern Environmental Law Center a envoyé cette semaine une lettre au Département de la Santé du comté de Shelby, où se trouve Memphis, et à un bureau régional de l'Agence de Protection de l'Environnement au nom de plusieurs groupes locaux, demandant aux régulateurs d'enquêter sur xAI pour l'utilisation non autorisée de ces turbines et la pollution qu'elles engendrent.

La lettre note que xAI « a installé au moins 18 turbines à combustion de gaz au cours des derniers mois (et que d'autres pourraient être en cours d'installation). »

L'entreprise utilise ces turbines pour alimenter l'installation, mais son plan à long terme est d'utiliser l'électricité fournie par la compagnie locale, Memphis Light, Gas and Water, et la Tennessee Valley Authority.

MLGW a déclaré à CNBC qu'elle avait commencé à fournir 50 mégawatts d'électricité à xAI au début du mois d'août. Cependant, l'installation xAI nécessite encore 100 mégawatts supplémentaires. La compagnie a installé plus de disjoncteurs et a commencé à améliorer les lignes de transmission dans la région pour se préparer à la consommation d'électricité accrue par xAI.

Musk, qui est également le PDG de Tesla et de SpaceX et propriétaire de la société de médias sociaux X, a créé xAI en 2023 pour développer des modèles de langage et des produits d'IA destinés à concurrencer ceux de Google, Microsoft et OpenAI. Le produit initial de la société est un chatbot appelé Grok, présenté comme une alternative politiquement incorrecte à ChatGPT d'OpenAI. Les modèles d'IA nécessitent généralement des quantités massives d'énergie pour l'entraînement des données et le traitement.

« Cette usine nécessite une quantité énorme d'électricité », ont écrit les défenseurs dans la lettre.

Certaines des 18 turbines sont visibles depuis la route autour de la propriété et, selon la lettre des défenseurs, émettent des polluants atmosphériques appelés oxydes d'azote (NOx) qui aggravent un problème de smog de longue date dans la région. Le comté de Shelby a reçu une note « F » de l'American Lung Association pour son smog.

Elon Musk a demandé à Nvidia d'expédier des milliers de puces d'IA réservées à Tesla à X et xAI.

Selon le site Web des Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, même de faibles niveaux d'oxydes d'azote dans l'air peuvent irriter les yeux, le nez, la gorge et les poumons d'une personne, provoquant toux, essoufflement, fatigue et nausées. Respirer des niveaux élevés d'oxydes d'azote peut provoquer des « brûlures rapides, des spasmes et un gonflement des tissus dans la gorge et les voies respiratoires supérieures », ainsi que d'autres problèmes de santé graves, selon l'agence.

Les entreprises du Tennessee sont généralement tenues d'obtenir des permis pour exploiter les types de turbines utilisées par xAI. Les permis établiraient la concentration admissible des émissions et détermineraient les exigences d'efficacité pour les moteurs.

# « Impact significatif sur la santé et l'environnement »

Un permis exigerait également des tests de qualité de l'air pour s'assurer que les utilisateurs ne polluent pas plus que prévu dans la région en raison de problèmes comme une mauvaise maintenance des moteurs.

« La principale préoccupation reste qu'il y a eu très peu de transparence et d'opportunité de participation publique pour le projet xAI », a déclaré Amanda Garcia, avocate principale au bureau du Tennessee du Southern Environmental Law Center, à CNBC. La préoccupation supplémentaire, a-t-elle déclaré, est que cela a « déjà un impact significatif sur la santé et l'environnement de la communauté environnante ».

Les groupes ont écrit dans la lettre que les turbines de xAI déjà en place ont la capacité d'émettre environ 130 tonnes d'oxydes d'azote par an, ce qui en ferait la neuvième plus grande source de ces polluants dans le comté. Leur capacité combinée pourrait alimenter environ 50 000 foyers.

Les entreprises dirigées par Musk ont une histoire de construction d'installations ou d'exploitation d'équipements à haute émission sans obtenir au préalable les permis nécessaires.

CNBC a rapporté plus tôt ce mois-ci que SpaceX exploitait un système de déluge d'eau et de refroidissement dans son installation de lancement à Boca Chica, au Texas, déchargeant à plusieurs reprises des eaux usées industrielles sans permis, en violation de la Clean Water Act.

L'entreprise de creusement de tunnels de Musk, The Boring Co., a également été condamnée à une amende par les régulateurs environnementaux du Texas pour un problème similaire — déverser des eaux usées dans le fleuve Colorado à Bastrop, Texas, sans demander de permis ni installer de contrôles de pollution appropriés.

Tesla a été cité par un régulateur de la pollution de l'air en Californie en 2021 pour avoir installé et modifié un équipement d'atelier de peinture qui émettait des polluants atmosphériques dangereux, sans permis et examens comme l'exige la Clean Air Act.

Le bureau régional de l'EPA couvrant Memphis n'a pas répondu à une demande de commentaire. xAI non plus.

1f0yqiq,Culpabiliser de prendre l'avion,"Hello, bon peut être que la réponse est facile à prendre mais voilà je vous explique ma situation 

Je culpabilise de prendre l'avion et de faire un doctorat en partenariat avec des entreprises qui travaillent avec ces avions. 

Je suis actuellement en première année de doctorat en sciences de l'Atmosphère et du Climat à Montréal. Lors de ma revue de littérature, j'ai regardé les prédictions du nombre de passagers aériens et le nombre d'avions en service pour les prochaines années, et franchement ça fait peur. Ça me fait énormément culpabiliser de me dire que mes travaux, certes utiles car ça peut sauver des gens, participent indirectement à cette évolution. 

J'ai l'impression que les gens autour de moi, travaillant dans le climat et la physique des nuages, se voilent la face en faisant de la compensation carbone en se disant que l'ingénierie nous sauvera. Elle nous aidera d'une certaine manière mais rien ne vaut une réduction de l'utilisation des avions. 

Je regrette d'avoir commencé ce doctorat, j'ai fait énormément de sacrifices pour venir ici (séparation avec une de mes plus belles relations à cause de la distance, éloignement avec la famille ...). Je me sens stupide. Je comprends  que l'avion est important et indispensable pour certaines personnes mais de là à justifier le double d'avions en service dans 15 ans par rapport à aujourd'hui, je comprends pas. 

Mes travaux sont intéressant et je pourrais me tourner plus tard après le doctorat sur les éoliennes mais j'ai l'impression que ce n'est pas trop ce qui me correspond.

Qu'est ce que vous en pensez ? Des avis, conseils ?

1exj4wm,La Chine lance la construction de onze nouveaux réacteurs nucléaires,"**DÉCRYPTAGE** - Le géant asiatique possède 56 réacteurs atomiques en service, autant que la France. Il poursuit son ambitieux plan de développement de cette électricité décarbonée.

Responsable de près d’un tiers des émissions mondiales de gaz à effet de serre, la Chine est engagée à marche forcée dans la transition énergétique. Pékin fonde sa « révolution énergétique » sur l’essor des renouvelables et du nucléaire. C’est dans cet élan que s’inscrit la décision du Conseil d’État, ce lundi 19 août, de donner son feu vert pour la construction de onze nouveaux réacteurs atomiques.

L’empire du Milieu figure déjà parmi les champions mondiaux du nucléaire civil. Avec 56 réacteurs opérationnels, soit exactement autant que la France, Pékin se place au rang de troisième puissance nucléaire civile, en termes de capacités installées. La puissance asiatique avance à pas de géant, avec 27 réacteurs en construction, si bien qu’elle pourrait se hisser à la première place du classement, devant les États-Unis (94 réacteurs) et la France. D’après The Economist, le pays cible la mise en service inégalée de 6 à 8 réacteurs annuellement.

# Le charbon

La Chine a pour objectif de doubler la part du nucléaire dans son mix électrique d’ici 2035, qui en représentait 5 % en 2023 selon l’Agence internationale de l’énergie atomique (AIEA). Une ambition crédible, au regard de la rapidité avec laquelle se sont déployés les derniers réacteurs chinois. Le temps de construction d’un réacteur dans le pays s’élève à 5,7 années. La moyenne s’établit à 6,6 années en France (allongée par les 17 ans de chantier de l’EPR de Flamanville) et 8,6 aux États-Unis. 

L’enjeu est de taille, puisque la Chine dépend encore en grande majorité du charbon. Un rapport de Global Energy Monitor soulignait encore récemment que Pékin était responsable de deux tiers de l’augmentation des nouvelles capacités de production de charbon établies à l’échelle planétaire. Un développement en contradiction avec l’objectif de neutralité carbone pour 2060, mais qui reste toutefois indispensable en Chine. L’industrie du charbon assure près de 2,7 millions d’emplois et reste surtout synonyme de « sécurité énergétique ».

Les projets nucléaires sont pilotés par des entreprises d’État. China National Nuclear Power (CNPC), qui correspondait avant 1988 au ministère chargé du Nucléaire, a indiqué avoir reçu l’approbation pour trois réacteurs, tandis qu’une autre entreprise publique, State Power Investment Corp, a dit être autorisée pour deux autres. CGN Power Co, la filiale cotée en Bourse de la société nationale China General Nuclear Power Corp, a annoncé dans un communiqué adressé à la Bourse de Hongkong avoir obtenu l’assentiment des autorités pour six réacteurs, répartis sur trois sites. L’investissement total pour les onze réacteurs devrait avoisiner les 220 milliards de yuans (27,8 milliards d’euros).

Les ambitions nucléaires de Pékin ne s’arrêtent pas aux frontières du pays. « La Chine vise à construire 30 centrales nucléaires à l’étranger d’ici 2030 », annonçait déjà en 2016 le président de la China National Nuclear Corporation. Pour l’heure, seuls une poignée de réacteurs sont construits ou en chantier à l’étranger, la Russie restant la championne incontestée de l’export de centrales atomiques.

Premièrement, j'espère écrire ce message au bon endroit.
Pour expliquer ma situation, je vis à l'étranger depuis 7 ans, et commence à anticiper un retour (sous 2-3 ans) en France. Et mon projet à mon retour est de reprendre la maison de mon arrière-grand-père, perdue en montagne au alentour du Puy-de-Dôme.
Ce que j'aime avec cet endroit est qu'il y a un grand terrain entouré de sapins et autres grand arbres, mais malheureusement, ceux-ci disparaissent années après années. La tempête de 1999 en a tombé certains, et fragilisé d'autres (3 morts dans les trois dernières années par exemple), les nouveaux poteaux électriques le long de la route ont forcé la coupe de beaucoup d'autres, et une nouvelle voisine un peu trop citadine avait commencé à couper des chênes mitoyens (5 avant de l'apprendre et tout stopper...).
Bref, la ""maison dans la forêt"" que j'ai connu petit l'est de moins en moins.
Ce qui m'amène au but de ce poste : dans mon plan d'agencement du terrain, j'envisage de planter une trentaine d'arbres (noisetier, chêne, pommier, etc.), ainsi qu'une haie sur le bord côté route (environ 150 mètres). Ceci a un fort coût, mais je me demandais s'il existait des aides financières pour ce type de projet qui amènerais plus de biodiversité dans le coin. Bien sûr je serai ouvert à laisser le choix des arbres et surtout de la haie (aucune préférence) pour être éligible.
Je me demandais aussi, le jour où je concrétiserai ce projet, quels sont les organismes/associations qui seraient de bons conseils ?
Voilà, désolé pour le long poste, et merci à ceux qui iront jusqu'au bout et m'apporteront des réponses.

1ervllt,Elon Musk affirme que vous pouvez « toujours manger du steak » malgré la crise climatique - que dit la science ?,"Les gens peuvent ""toujours manger un steak"" malgré la hausse rapide des températures mondiales, selon Elon Musk. Le milliardaire PDG de X (anciennement Twitter) et de Tesla a fait ce commentaire lors de sa conversation en direct le 12 août avec le candidat républicain à la présidence des États-Unis, Donald Trump. Au cours de ces deux heures, Musk et Trump ont partagé leurs points de vue sur la crise climatique parmi d'autres sujets.

""Ce n'est pas comme si la maison était en feu immédiatement"", a déclaré Musk, donnant un délai de 50 à 100 ans pour que la société humaine devienne ""majoritairement durable"" et ""probablement acceptable.""

Il a ajouté qu'""en balance,"" il pourrait être préférable de décarboniser plus rapidement plutôt que plus lentement, mais ""sans diaboliser l'industrie du pétrole et du gaz"" ou diaboliser les gens pour manger du bœuf.

La science climatique dit le contraire.

# **Répéter des contre-vérités**

La défense de Musk de la viande rouge fait écho aux commentaires précédemment faits par des personnalités politiques américaines. Le Secrétaire à l'Agriculture Thomas Vilsack, un démocrate, a déclaré au Guardian en 2021 : ""Je ne pense pas que nous devions réduire la quantité de viande ou de bétail produite aux États-Unis. Et un pourcentage significatif est exporté. La question n'est pas de manger plus ou moins ou de produire plus ou moins. La question est de rendre la production plus durable.""

Ses remarques sont survenues après que les républicains ont propagé le mensonge selon lequel Joe Biden allait retirer les burgers des Américains.

Trump a récemment diffusé le même mensonge concernant la candidate démocrate à la présidence et vice-présidente Kamala Harris. Lors de ses rassemblements, Trump a affirmé plusieurs fois que Harris interdirait la viande rouge si elle remportait l'élection en novembre. En réalité, Harris a déclaré qu'elle soutenait la création d'incitations pour que les gens mangent plus sainement et de manière plus durable.

# **L'empreinte climatique de la viande**

Selon une étude réalisée par une équipe de scientifiques internationaux, les émissions du système alimentaire mondial nous feront largement dépasser les 1,5°C de réchauffement même si nous arrêtions immédiatement de brûler des combustibles fossiles.

L'élevage d'animaux, en particulier les vaches, pour la viande a l'impact le plus important sur le climat et l'environnement de tous les aliments. L'agriculture animale contribue à au moins 16,5 % des émissions mondiales totales. La raison pour laquelle les ruminants comme les vaches sont si nocifs pour le climat est qu'ils produisent du méthane, un gaz à effet de serre puissant avec jusqu'à 80 fois le potentiel de réchauffement du dioxyde de carbone au cours de ses 20 premières années dans l'atmosphère. De plus, l'immense quantité de terres utilisées pour faire paître les animaux ou cultiver des aliments pour les nourrir — 80 % de toutes les terres agricoles — pourrait autrement absorber du carbone si elle était rendue à la nature.

""Je ne pourrais pas être plus en désaccord avec Elon Musk,"" a déclaré la Dr Shireen Kassam, fondatrice de Plant Based Health Professionals, à Plant Based News. ""L'action la plus percutante que nous puissions tous entreprendre pour réduire notre impact sur la planète est de passer à un régime à base de plantes, l'élimination de la consommation de viande rouge étant cruciale.""

Plusieurs études ont montré qu'un passage généralisé à des régimes à base de plantes est essentiel pour réduire les émissions. Sans ce changement alimentaire, les tendances mondiales de consommation de viande entraîneraient une augmentation estimée à 80 % des émissions alimentaires et du défrichement des terres.

# **""Menace réelle et présente""**

Contrairement à l'affirmation de Musk selon laquelle ""la maison"" n'est pas ""immédiatement en feu,"" le monde a déjà commencé à franchir des limites climatiques clés. Pour la première fois, les températures mondiales ont dépassé la limite de 1,5°C pendant toute une année à partir de février 2023.

Pendant ce temps, des scientifiques ont déclaré que la crise climatique avait rendu la chaleur extrême aux États-Unis et au Mexique plus tôt cette année environ 35 fois plus probable. La chaleur a coûté la vie à plus de 100 personnes au Mexique. En Europe, on estime à 50 000 le nombre de décès liés à la chaleur en 2023, qui a été la deuxième année la plus chaude jamais enregistrée pour le continent.

""La crise climatique est une menace réelle et présente,"" a déclaré la Dr Kassam. ""En fait, l'OMS a déclaré que la crise climatique est une menace fondamentale pour la santé humaine, et qu'elle impacte déjà négativement la santé de nombreuses populations dans le monde.""

Face aux parkings bondés et aux sentiers embouteillés, l’immensité des paysages peine à chasser la sensation d’être à l’étroit.

Pour cause, près de 500 à 800.000 visiteurs arpentent chaque année le Parc national et convergent, pour la plupart, vers une poignée de spots ""incontournables"", comme on peut le lire dans les brochures touristiques.

En haute saison, vallon de la Gordolasque, lac d’Allos ou vallée des Merveilles sont ainsi pris d’assaut, bien que ces sites soient tous inscrits en cœur du parc où la réglementation est la plus sévère.

Avec près de 550km de réseau, ces montagnes dominant six vallées comptent pourtant d’innombrables sentiers alternatifs (1). Comment faire pour les mettre en avant? Ou est-ce une fausse bonne idée?

# Préférer la pédagogie aux quotas

""Nous n’avons pas de position arrêtée, cela dépend des sites"", rétorque Aline Comeau. La directrice du Parc estime ""qu’il y a des avantages et des inconvénients"" à répartir le flux de randonneurs.

Elle pose le dilemme: ""Parce que des espaces sont peu fréquentés, ils sont mieux préservés. Mais à l’inverse, les sites populaires sont trop exposés. La faune y est très perturbée. Il faut donc trouver un équilibre.""

Mais comment s’y prendre? Contrairement au Parc national des Calanques qui a mis en place un système de quotas, le Mercantour se refuse à prendre des ""mesures aussi drastiques [...] Seule une partie de la vallée des Merveilles n’est accessible qu’en visites guidées sur réservation afin de protéger les gravures rupestres"", rappelle Aline Comeau.

À ""l’interdiction"", la directrice ""préfère la pédagogie. A l’année, entre vingt à trente gardes assermentés effectuent des maraudes. L’été, ils sont renforcés par une trentaine de saisonniers. Ils apprennent à un public pas toujours sensibilisé, que certains comportements sont interdits.""

Ce qui n’empêche toujours pas les visiteurs de se masser aux mêmes endroits...

# Plus de transparence pour ne pas ""décevoir""

""Nous ne pouvons pas forcer les randonneurs à découvrir d’autres points d’intérêts. Mais ils peuvent le faire d’eux-mêmes si nous les informons correctement"", relève Emmanuel Gastaud, chargé de la communication du Parc. Il fait remarquer ""qu’un site surfréquenté n’est pas séduisant pour quelqu’un qui vient en montagne"", là où l’on vient chercher ""du dépaysement et du calme"".

Pour éviter de ""décevoir"" ses visiteurs, le Parc joue donc la carte de la transparence. Et revendique ""une première en France [...] dans un espace naturel sensible"": en juillet, ""un compteur intelligent"" a été mis en place au parking du Countet dans la Gordolasque pour en mesurer, en direct, le taux d’occupation (fixé à 6.000 visiteurs par mois). Celui-ci est consultable sur le site Internet affluences.com (2) tout en étant affiché dans la vallée, sur les panneaux longeant la route, revendique le Parc.

À l’instar du lac d’Allos qui ressemble parfois à une petite station balnéaire, version haute montagne avec des pics de 1.000 visiteurs par jour. Depuis 2021, en accord avec la municipalité, la capacité du parking est limitée de 30% grâce à un système de réservation à l’avance.

Ces dispositifs sont-ils voués à se généraliser sur les sites en tension? ""En nous appuyant sur l’intelligence artificielle et les GPS, les premiers résultats sont satisfaisants"", assure Aline Comeau. La directrice annonce donc un déploiement ""au cas par cas, d’ici les prochaines années"".

# «Les gens vont au plus simple et suivent l’itinéraire le mieux balisé»

« Comparé aux autres massifs des Alpes, le Mercantour n’est pas si fréquenté que ça.» Pourtant, Michèle Viale, présidente départementale du Club alpin français, observe que les randonneurs se retrouvent « sur les mêmes chemins». Comment l’expliquer ?

« Les gens vont au plus simple et suivent l’itinéraire le mieux balisé», rétorque la montagnarde. Chevronnée, elle n’hésite pas à s’aventurer sur des sentiers alternatifs qui sont «peu, voir pas entretenus». Résultat : ils deviennent des sentes, s’effacent dans les éboulis.

# Réparations post-Alex pour 3,5 millions d’euros

Parce que les cairns érigés par les habitués du massif ne suffisent pas à se repérer quand on est moins expérimenté, la présidente regrette que ces itinéraires ne soient pas «mieux entretenus, balisés et sécurisés».

Sur son site internet, le Parc national du Mercantour rappelle que ces 16 dernières années, plus de 3 millions d’euros ont été investis pour la réfection des sentiers.

Il est aussi précisé que la réparation des dégâts subséquents à la tempête Alex, le 2 octobre 2020, s’élève à 3,5 millions d’euros. Près de la moitié de cette somme a été engagée dès 2021 pour réaliser un tiers des réparations sur une période de trois ans.

ARCHES est le premier des sept centres d'hydrogène à travers le pays à signer officiellement leur accord avec le DOE.**

**Le centre ARCHES facilitera un réseau de sites de production d'hydrogène propre et renouvelable pour réduire l'utilisation des combustibles fossiles dans toute la Californie, avec pour objectif ultime de décarboniser les transports publics, les poids lourds et les opérations portuaires de 2 millions de tonnes métriques par an – ce qui équivaut à peu près aux émissions annuelles de 445 000 voitures à essence.**
**« La Californie révolutionne la façon dont une grande économie mondiale peut assainir ses plus grandes industries. Nous allons utiliser de l'hydrogène propre et renouvelable pour alimenter nos ports et nos transports publics – transporter les personnes et les marchandises là où elles doivent aller, mais sans la pollution locale de l'air. Grâce à l'administration Biden-Harris, la Californie est ravie de pionnier cette initiative de classe mondiale qui montrera à d'autres États et pays ce qui est possible lorsque vous priorisez l'énergie propre et la santé publique. »**
**Gouverneur Gavin Newsom**

**La semaine dernière, la Californie a mené la nation dans de multiples innovations en matière de transport alimenté à l'hydrogène, avec le premier ferry entièrement alimenté à l'hydrogène au monde dans la baie de San Francisco et un vol hydrogène-électrique réussi de 523 miles.**

Les agressions par les loups sont rares, même si elles existent, mais la plus grosse conséquence pour les  randonneurs est la présence de chiens de bergers de type Patou qui sont très agressifs autour des troupeaux. Les troupeaux voient aussi beaucoup de bêtes, malgré les précautions, dévorées par les loups.

Il y a bien en théorie une technique pour le pas énerver un Patou, il faut rester calme, ne pas le regarder dans les yeux, continuer à marcher lentement, mais honnêtement, ce n'est pas le genre de choses que l'on a envie de voir tester notamment par ses enfants qui peuvent avoir peur des chiens, surtout que si on se plante, ça peut être de très graves morsures. Je n'ai pas rencontré cette année de troupeaux,  mais de nombreux randonneurs m'ont dit que c'était insupportable  de croiser un troupeau, et que les presque accidents arrivaient souvent. Il y a eu d'ailleurs dans la région où j'étais plusieurs personnes blessées suite à une agression par des Patou.

Alors, se pose la question de si de la randonnée, du loup, ou de l'élevage en Alpage, l'un d'eux n'est pas en trop dans nos Alpes françaises.

Et je trouve que la randonnée est un bon loisir. A l'époque où l'on parle de l'impact écologique des vacances, c'est un moyen de se changer les idées dans un paysage vraiment différent (nous avons  vu des icebergs dans un lac par exemple dans un paysage qui ressemblait au Groenland) à quelques centaines de kilomètres de chez soi, et de plus au frais, et tout ceci en pratiquant le meilleur sport pour la santé qui est la marche.

L'élevage est aussi important pour les habitants de ces vallées. Du coup, je me demande si c'est le loup qui n'y est pas de trop.

Je serais ravi d'avoir vos avis, et notamment comment ça se passe aux endroits que le loup n'a jamais quitté (comme l'est des Alpes italiennes...).",0,23,2024-08-04 06:39:26,fr,ecologie

1ej586w,Une étape importante dans le déploiement des bus à hydrogène : le projet européen JIVE 1 se termine avec des avancées cruciales,"*Bruxelles, Belgique — 31 juillet 2024*

L'Initiative Conjointe pour les Véhicules à Hydrogène à travers l'Europe (JIVE 1), un projet ambitieux visant à soutenir le déploiement et l'exploitation des bus à hydrogène et des stations de ravitaillement à travers l'Europe, est arrivé à son terme. Cette initiative phare a réalisé des progrès significatifs vers ses objectifs initiaux avec le déploiement de 131 bus à pile à combustible en Allemagne, en Italie, aux Pays-Bas et au Royaume-Uni, marquant une étape importante vers un transport urbain durable. Son projet frère, JIVE 2, continuera jusqu'en juin 2025.

Co-financé par le Partenariat pour l'Hydrogène Propre, le projet JIVE 1 a atteint des jalons clés tels que :

* **Participation accrue des fabricants**: Au début du projet, peu de fournisseurs proposaient des bus à pile à combustible. Aujourd'hui, plusieurs modèles de différents fabricants sont disponibles.

* **Réduction des coûts** : Le prix cible de 650 000 € pour un bus standard de 12 m a été atteint sur tous les sites, rendant les bus à pile à combustible plus économiquement viables.

* **Bus à double étage à pile à combustible** : Les premières flottes mondiales de bus à double étage à pile à combustible ont été développées et déployées.

* **Performance zéro émission** : Les bus ont démontré une autonomie constante allant jusqu'à 500 kilomètres dans des conditions climatiques diverses, prouvant leur fiabilité et leur flexibilité.

* **Amélioration de l'efficacité énergétique**: Les objectifs initiaux de consommation de carburant ont été dépassés, avec des valeurs exceptionnellement basses de 6,5 kg/100 km, renforçant l'argument économique en faveur de la technologie des piles à combustible.

* **Accords commerciaux à long terme**: Des accords avec les fournisseurs de bus et d'hydrogène ont été établis pour des opérations allant jusqu'à dix ans.

* **Expansion de l'expérience des opérateurs**: Plus d'opérateurs ont maintenant une expérience pratique dans le déploiement et l'exploitation des bus à pile à combustible en opérations régulières.

* **Partage de connaissances étendu** : Le projet a diffusé ses résultats par le biais de visites de sites, de publications, de présentations, et de réunions de groupes d'utilisateurs de bus.

Les projets JIVE ont également organisé des démonstrations itinérantes de bus à pile à combustible à travers l'Europe centrale et orientale, touchant un total de 13 pays, et une quatrième démonstration est prévue pour la Scandinavie d'ici la mi-2025. Ces événements ont sensibilisé et soutenu l'adoption des bus à hydrogène dans un nombre croissant de pays.

**Défis et étapes futures**

Malgré les succès du projet, des défis tels que la fiabilité des approvisionnements en hydrogène et des stations de ravitaillement ont été rencontrés. Aborder ces questions reste crucial pour les futures opérations commerciales.

 « *Je suis fier de dire que le projet phare JIVE a dépassé nos objectifs initiaux en déployant 131 bus à pile à combustible, démontrant des réductions de coûts significatives, des avancées technologiques et des bénéfices environnementaux. Grâce au financement du Partenariat pour l'Hydrogène Propre, ce projet de grande envergure a considérablement avancé la commercialisation des bus à pile à combustible et promu une mobilité urbaine plus durable. JIVE a également ouvert la voie à une adoption plus large des bus à pile à combustible dans d'autres villes européennes et sert d'exemple réussi du leadership de l'UE pour atteindre la neutralité carbone d'ici 2050*. » a déclaré Mirela Atanasiu, Cheffe de l'Unité des Opérations et de la Communication, Partenariat pour l'Hydrogène Propre.

« *Le projet JIVE1 a grandement contribué à l'avancement du secteur des bus à pile à combustible en Europe. De nombreuses leçons ont été tirées, qui sont très pertinentes pour les autorités de transport public, les opérateurs et autres parties intéressées par l'hydrogène dans les applications de mobilité. J'encourage toutes les parties intéressées à tirer parti des résultats du projet. JIVE 1 a impliqué un effort majeur de la part d'un large éventail d'organisations et d'individus, et je tiens à remercier tous les partenaires pour leur excellente collaboration. Nous sommes également extrêmement reconnaissants envers le Partenariat pour l'Hydrogène Propre pour leur soutien, leur patience et leur flexibilité tout au long du projet.* » Michael Dolman, partenaire chez ERM (coordinateur du projet JIVE).

Ce questionnaire est destiné uniquement aux **personnes majeures.** Ce questionnaire dure en moyenne 7 minutes.

Voici une définition de l’éco-conception *(ecologie.gouv.fr)* : ""L’éco-conception consiste à intégrer la protection de l’environnement dès la conception des biens ou services. Elle a pour objectif de réduire les impacts environnementaux des produits tout au long de leur cycle de vie : extraction des matières premières, production, distribution, utilisation et fin de vie.""

Merci d'avance pour votre temps et votre précieuse contribution.

1ei1ybm,Avis sur un projet d'assistance a la rénovation énergétique,"Bonjour à tous, 



Cela fait plusieurs années que je m’intéresse au sujet de la rénovation énergétique des foyers. Je travaille en ce moment sur un projet open-source et j’aimerais avoir votre avis. Au cours de mes travaux de rénovation, j’ai remarqué que comprendre et diagnostiquer la performance énergétique de nos maisons (isolation, chauffage, etc.) est souvent complexe et nécessite généralement l'intervention d'un expert. Et une fois le diagnostic fait, établir un plan d'action concret pour améliorer cette performance n'est pas toujours simple. Est-ce qu'une pompe à chaleur serait adaptée à mon système de chauffage actuel ? Qu'est-ce qui serait le plus économique et écologique pour moi ?



Pour tenter de répondre à ces problématiques, je pense à développer un ""digital twin"" pour la rénovation énergétique. L'idée serait de créer un modèle numérique détaillé de notre maison, incorporant autant d'informations que l’on souhaite de manière simple. Ce modèle permettrait d'établir un diagnostic précis et de proposer des solutions personnalisées, adaptées à chaque cas particulier.

Je sais qu’il existe déjà des ébauches de solutions semblables (HelloWatt ou autre) mais j’ai toujours trouvé que ça n'était jamais assez précis et conforme à chacune de nos situations particulières.

Merci d'avance pour votre aide et vos conseils.

Paris 2024 s’est engagé à organiser les premiers Jeux Olympiques écologiques. En pleine urgence climatique, la compatibilité avec l’Accord de Paris et la réalisation d’objectifs ambitieux suscitent de nombreuses questions.

Dès sa candidature, Paris 2024 a affiché une ambition claire : organiser des Jeux Olympiques à impact positif pour le climat. Mais, en pleine urgence climatique, un événement d’une telle envergure est-il vraiment compatible avec [l’Accord de Paris de 2015](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wedemain.fr%2Fdechiffrer%2Faccord-de-paris-quel-bilan-cinq-ans-apres-pour-la-cop21%2F) ? Les Jeux peuvent-ils être à la fois verts et inclusifs ? Les acteurs du BTP profitent-ils de ce « terrain de jeux » pour construire la ville de demain ?

Du 26 juillet au 8 septembre, tous les regards seront tournés vers la France. Pour Christophe Béchu, Ministre de la Transition écologique et de la Cohésion des territoires, c’est une [*« opportunité historique de montrer qu’il est possible de conjuguer loisirs, sport et défi climatique »*](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wwf.fr%2Fprojets%2Fparis-2024-premiers-jeux-alignes-avec-les-objectifs-de-laccord-de-paris). Il faut le reconnaître, c’est la première fois que l’ambition est aussi élevée : diviser par deux l’empreinte carbone par rapport aux deux éditions précédentes. *« Les Jeux de Paris 2024 ont placé la barre très haute en matière environnementale, avec une ligne directrice forte : livrer des Jeux responsables alignés sur l’Accord de Paris et l’agenda 2030 de l’ONU »*, a déclaré Georgina Grenon, Directrice de l’Excellence environnementale.

# Les défis écologiques des grands événements sportifs

Jusqu’à présent, manifestations sportives et écologie font rarement bon ménage. *« Surtout quand il s’agit de grands événements planétaires qui déplacent athlètes, journalistes et visiteurs, le plus souvent par avion, et consomment d’immenses quantités de ressources matérielles »*, a concédé Pascal Canfin, ex-directeur du WWF France. L’ONG a accepté d’accompagner le comité d’organisation qui a théoriquement suivi une partie de ses recommandations : réduction de moitié des émissions carbones, 100 % d’approvisionnement en énergies renouvelables, 100 % de l’alimentation certifiée, 100 % des sites accessibles en transports en commun et à vélo.

Paradoxalement, la durabilité n’est pas mentionnée parmi les principaux objectifs du Comité International Olympique (CIO) sur son site officiel. L’organisation des Jeux repose sur un partenariat entre le CIO et le comité d’organisation des Jeux Olympiques (COJO). En termes de management de l’événementiel responsable, le CIO a obtenu la certification ISO2012:2012 pour ses propres événements institutionnels. Une norme qui avait été créée à l’occasion des Jeux de Londres.

# Management de la transformation écologique et du carbone

Dès sa candidature, le COJO a mobilisé un Comité afin d’[accompagner la transformation écologique par domaines clés](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wedemain.fr%2Frespirer%2Fles-jo-de-paris-2024-decrocheront-ils-la-medaille-verte_a4179-html%2F) : carbone, biodiversité, économie circulaire, énergie, restauration, numérique, construction, innovation et accompagnement au changement. Présidé par le biologiste Gilles Bœuf, il est composé d’experts d’organisations référentes : l’ADEME, l’I4CE – Institute for Climate Economics, l’Iddri, ORÉE, l’agence Chartier Dalix, l’Institut du Numérique Responsable, l’Agence Internationale de l’Énergie, le label ISR et du chef cuisinier, Thierry Marx.

Le lancement d’un nouveau calculateur carbone a pour fonction d’accompagner les équipes organisatrices dans leur impact personnel et professionnel. Ce « Coach Climat événements » a été adapté et mis à disposition du secteur sportif et événementiel français. En outre, la flotte de véhicules des équipes organisatrices est majoritairement constituée de véhicules électriques et hybrides, fournis par Toyota, partenaire mondial mobilité des Jeux de Paris 2024.

# Objectif de neutralité carbone et mécanismes de compensation pour Paris 2024

Sur le volet du pilotage des émissions globales, Paris 2024 s’est fixée de ne pas dépasser 1,58 million de tonnes équivalent CO2. *« La définition d’un budget carbone avant les Jeux est une bonne chose. Toutefois, la méthodologie utilisée pour calculer cette empreinte reste opaque »*, décrypte Guillaume Kerlero de Rosbo, ingénieur, Directeur Transition écologique à l’Institut Rousseau, cofondateur du collectif climat-énergie « éclaircies ».

Selon le comité d’organisation, le budget carbone des Jeux de Paris 2024 se décompose comme suit :

L’association a co-publié, avec [Carbon Market Watch](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fcarbonmarketwatch.org%2Fpublications%2Fviser-le-vert-evaluation-de-la-strategie-climat-et-de-la-communication-des-jeux-olympiques-de-paris-2024%2F), une évaluation de la stratégie climat des JOP et de sa communication. Quid de la flamme, le symbole des Olympiades ? Si le voyage, effectué pour la première fois à la voile depuis la Grèce, a envoyé un message en faveur de la transition, le parcours complet interroge – du Péloponnèse à Athènes, puis des territoires ultramarins aux nombreux sites de la Métropole, en terminant par la capitale. Impossible de calculer son bilan exact.

# Les premiers Jeux avec une « contribution positive pour le climat », vraiment ?

En 2023, le comité d’organisation (COJO) a dû revenir sur cette formulation pour respecter la recommandation de l’ADEME. Benjamin Lévêque, Responsable Climat et Biodiversité de Paris 2024 a confirmé sur franceinfo : *« Nous trouvons que ce n’est pas raisonnable scientifiquement et compte tenu de l’urgence »*. Il s’agit de ne plus laisser penser qu’une compétition de cette ampleur est neutre en termes d’impact climatique. *« Ce changement de dénomination ne signifie en aucun cas une baisse des ambitions en la matière »*, a cependant déclaré le Conseil d’administration des Jeux de Paris 2024. Mais sa stratégie repose essentiellement sur des mécanismes de compensation carbone. Il s’agit d’un *« soutien massif à des projets positifs pour le climat »*, de restauration et de conservation des forêts et des océans.

En résumé, Paris 2024 s’est fixé des objectifs ambitieux pour réduire son empreinte carbone et promouvoir des pratiques durables, mais le chemin pour atteindre ces objectifs reste semé d’embûches. Les critiques sur la méthodologie de calcul de l’empreinte carbone, la faisabilité des engagements pris, et l’efficacité des mécanismes de compensation soulèvent des questions essentielles sur la capacité réelle des Jeux à être véritablement écologiques.

# Martin Müller (géographe) : « La promesse d’un bilan carbone positif s’est retournée contre les organisateurs »

**Professeur à l’Institut de géographie et durabilité de l’Université de Lausanne, Martin Müller étudie la transition écologique dans sa dimension urbaine. Ses recherches portent notamment sur les grands évènements sportifs, comme la Coupe du monde de football et les Jeux Olympiques. En 2021, il publie une étude dans** [**Nature Sustainability**](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41893-021-00696-5) **sur ce sujet.**  

# WE DEMAIN : Quelle est l’empreinte carbone moyenne des Jeux ?

**Dr Martin Müller :** Pour les Jeux Olympiques d’été, les émissions se situent entre 3 et 4,5 millions de tonnes de CO₂e. Cela équivaut à peu près au budget carbone annuel d’une ville de 1,5 à 3 millions d’habitants en 2050, qui respecterait l’Accord de Paris. Il s’agit donc d’un volume assez important. La première source d’émissions est constituée par les vols des visiteurs. Viennent ensuite les émissions grises des nouveaux bâtiments, qui varient considérablement en fonction de l’ampleur du programme de construction de l’hôte. 

# Que pensez-vous de la promesse de départ de Paris 2024 d’organiser des Jeux « neutres en carbone » ?

La promesse d’un bilan carbone positif s’est retournée contre les organisateurs. Ce type de formulation marketing repose sur un tour de passe-passe de la comptabilité carbone. Le CIO a pris un engagement en faveur de Jeux neutres, fondé surtout sur la compensation carbone. Des recherches ont montré que nombre de ces crédits de compensation ne sont pas fiables, car non réglementés. La plupart ne compense pas ce qui est promis. Les organisations sérieuses commencent à abandonner ce mécanisme. L’opinion publique et la recherche scientifique ont progressé ces dernières années sur ce sujet. Par exemple, des ONG ont fait reconnaître le greenwashing de la FIFA, qui avait présenté [la Coupe du monde de football au Qatar comme « neutre en carbone »](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wedemain.fr%2Fdechiffrer%2Fcoupe-du-monde-de-foot-et-bilan-carbone-carton-rouge-au-qatar%2F). 

# Le nouvel objectif carbone des Jeux de Paris vous paraît-il raisonnable ?

Cet objectif me paraît très ambitieux. Certes, la réduction de constructions neuves à un minimum est une manière importante de réduire l’empreinte carbone. Sur ce plan, Paris 2024 fera probablement mieux que la plupart des villes hôtes précédentes. Cependant, je ne vois pas de politique pour diminuer les déplacements en avion, l’autre grande source d’émissions qui devrait être la priorité. C’est la seule sur laquelle le CIO peut avoir une influence directe. 

# Pourrait-on imaginer des Jeux compatibles avec la transition écologique ?

Oui, ce ne serait même pas très difficile. Le déplacement de millions de personnes en avion pour assister à une compétition ou deux, n’est plus tenable. Une étape importante consisterait à amener les Olympiades au peuple, plutôt que l’inverse. Je pense à des stades beaucoup plus petits et à des « fan zones » conviviales partout dans le monde, qui éviteraient de parcourir la planète en avion. Durabilité ne rime pas avec absence d’amusement, au contraire ! D’ici 2050, les Jeux d’été devraient arriver à émettre autour de 0,5 million de tonnes de CO₂e. Il sera donc nécessaire de privilégier les transports publics et de s’abstenir de constructions [neuves.Paris](http://neuves.Paris) 2024 s’est engagé à organiser les premiers Jeux Olympiques écologiques. En pleine urgence climatique, la compatibilité avec l’Accord de Paris et la réalisation d’objectifs ambitieux suscitent de nombreuses questions.

1ee7y6r,Certaines marques de préservatifs et lubrifiants contiennent des niveaux dangereux de PFAS - étude ,"Plusieurs marques de préservatifs et de lubrifiants contiennent des niveaux alarmants de PFAS toxiques, appelés ""produits chimiques éternels"", y compris certains styles de Trojan et de K-Y Jelly, selon une nouvelle recherche.

Les tests effectués par le blog de défense des consommateurs Mamavation arrivent alors que des chercheurs ont découvert que la peau humaine absorbe ces produits chimiques à des niveaux beaucoup plus élevés que ce que l'on pensait auparavant.

La peau du pénis et du vagin est fine et ces organes ont un niveau élevé de vaisseaux sanguins, ce qui les rend particulièrement dangereux à exposer aux PFAS, a écrit Linda Birnbaum, conseillère scientifique pour Mamavation qui dirigeait auparavant le programme de toxicologie de l'Agence de protection de l'environnement, dans le rapport.

""Le vagin et le pénis sont des zones incroyablement vasculaires et l'exposition cutanée à ces zones est souvent plus élevée que dans d'autres parties du corps"", a déclaré Birnbaum.

Les PFAS sont une classe d'environ 15 000 produits chimiques souvent utilisés pour rendre les produits résistants à l'eau, aux taches et à la chaleur. Ils sont appelés ""produits chimiques éternels"" parce qu'ils ne se décomposent pas naturellement, et sont liés au cancer, aux problèmes de foie, aux troubles de la thyroïde, aux malformations congénitales, aux maladies rénales, à une immunité réduite et à d'autres problèmes de santé graves.

Les PFAS sont également considérés comme des toxiques pour la reproduction et des perturbateurs endocriniens liés à un faible poids à la naissance, à une diminution du nombre de spermatozoïdes, à l'hypertension artérielle induite par la grossesse, à l'infertilité et à une durée d'allaitement plus courte.

Ces produits chimiques sont probablement utilisés dans les préservatifs pour aider le latex à repousser l'humidité et les liquides.

""Il est certain d'un point de vue chimique que le tractus reproducteur féminin sera contaminé par certains des produits chimiques contenus dans les préservatifs"", a déclaré Teresa Heinz, chercheuse à l'Institut de politique scientifique verte, dans le rapport.

Les tests, effectués par un laboratoire certifié par l'Agence de protection de l'environnement et commandés par Mamavation, ont vérifié la présence de fluor, un marqueur des PFAS, dans 29 produits de santé reproductive.

Il a été trouvé dans les préservatifs ultra-fins Trojan Ultra Sensitivity, et à un niveau presque double dans les préservatifs Union Standard Ultra Thin Lubricated Male Latex. Parmi les lubrifiants figuraient le lubrifiant personnel classique à base d'eau K-Y Jelly, le gel Lola Tingling Mint Pleasure pour l'excitation ciblée et plusieurs autres.

Les PFAS sont utilisés dans des milliers de produits de consommation, des vêtements au maquillage en passant par les emballages alimentaires, mais il existe peu de réglementations au niveau fédéral. Cependant, la pression des défenseurs des consommateurs et certaines interdictions au niveau des États sur des utilisations spécifiques exercent une pression sur l'industrie pour qu'elle cesse d'utiliser ces produits chimiques.

""Parce que les préservatifs sont une exposition aux zones les plus sensibles du corps humain pour les hommes et les femmes, je recommanderais fortement à l'industrie d'identifier et d'éliminer immédiatement ces produits chimiques"", a écrit Birnbaum.

Il s'avère que ce mois-ci, je suis tombée à la bibliothèque sur l'essai d'Antoine Bueno ""Permis de procréer"" publié en 2019. Sa thèse repose sur deux fondements, je cite: 
""-Doit-on pouvoir se reproduire quelle que soit sa situation personnelle?
-Doit-on pouvoir se reproduire indéfiniment?""

Il aborde également la mise en œuvre (humainement et juridiquement).

Une réflexion importante à prendre en compte, c'est que selon les GINKs (Green Inclinations  No Kids), ne pas avoir d'enfant, ou du moins se limiter, est un geste écologique considérable, bien plus que le tri sélectif en lui-même. En outre, les dirigeants, les mœurs et les industriels nous poussent à procréer... mais il est temps de freiner la tendance surtout quand on constate que le Jour de dépassement des ressources naturelles est atteint chaque année de plus en plus tôt. En France, le 5 mai en 2022 contre le 30 décembre en 1970, selon Climate Selectra. 

Bien sûr, chacun continue d'agir comme bon le semble vu qu'on vit d'abord pour soi. Mais la conscience écologique, en particulier sur l'emprunte écologique d'un individu en plus, se doit d'être diffusée.

Et vous, vous en pensez quoi? Avez-vous déjà lu cet essai?

1e6yno4,Moovance : c'est réellement écologique comme application ?,"Bonjour,

Hier je regardais une vidéo, et d'entrée, le youtubeur fait une sponso pour une application nommée Moovance. Pour faire simple, l'application permet de convertir les déplacements que font les utilisateurs en argent à récupérer/dépenser chez des partenaires/dons pour des associations à condition que ceux-ci soient fait de manière écologique. On peut avoir des détails ici :

[https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceinter/podcasts/l-info-de-france-inter/l-info-de-france-inter-8543213](https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceinter/podcasts/l-info-de-france-inter/l-info-de-france-inter-8543213)

Je suis resté dubitatif, je n'ai pas installé l'application, mais là, spontanément, il y a une question qui me paraît évidente : comme ce type d'application se finance ? La seule chose que je peux imaginer, c'est la revente de données de géolocalisation.

Mais en réfléchissant encore plus : est-ce vraiment écolo ? Est-ce que ça incite réellement les gens à moins utiliser la voiture ? Est-ce que ça implique de garder sa 4G constamment active, et donc, est-ce que ça n'annule pas un peu les bénéfices ?

Je n'ai pas trouvé grand chose sur google à ce sujet, alors je me dis que peut-être ici des gens connaissent. Est-ce que ça a un réel intérêt écologique, ou est-ce juste une énième fumisterie sous couvert de green washing.",2,9,2024-07-19 04:20:23,fr,ecologie

« *En fumant ma cigarette, j’allumais le feu et je cramais tous les cadavres*. »

Bonjour

Nous dévoilons aujourd’hui une nouvelle enquête menée dans un élevage de plus de 5 000 canards situé à Châtillon-sur-Colmont en Mayenne (Pays de la Loire).

Anaïs, à l’origine du signalement, a travaillé dans cet élevage censé être en plein air.

Mais la réalité sur place est tout autre. Les canards n’ont pas accès à l’extérieur. Ils vivent sur une litière saturée d'urine et de fientes. Certains peinent à respirer, d'autres sont à l'agonie, ou déjà morts. Les cadavres sont brûlés ou jetés dans le champ du voisin, en toute illégalité.

Vous vous demandez qui commercialise la viande de ces canards ? C’est le groupe LDC, encore lui ! Nous vous parlons souvent du numéro 1 de la volaille en France, qui détient notamment les marques Le Gaulois et Loué. 

# Un élevage plein air où les canards sont… enfermés

Les canards de cet élevage sont élevés en free range, une méthode d’élevage qui permet, théoriquement, aux animaux d’accéder à l’extérieur.

Mais les canards n’ont pas accès au parcours extérieur, faute de clôtures en bon état !

« *Les trappes qu’il y a sur le côté du bâtiment, je ne les ai jamais vues ouvertes. On se moque un peu de tout le monde parce qu'ils ne sortaient jamais. [...] Les terrains ne sont pas aux normes. Ils ne sont pas accessibles parce que les grillages sont couchés par terre. [...] Il faudrait faire des travaux et le patron n'a pas trop envie.* »

# Les conditions d’élevage désastreuses engendrent une forte mortalité

Enfermés dans un bâtiment délabré, sur un sol souillé qui reste le même pendant 50 jours, un grand nombre de canards sont déplumés, halètent, agonisent et meurent. Ils manquent aussi parfois d’eau et de nourriture.

« Quand les canetons arrivent, c’est leur premier jour de vie. Ils arrivent l’après-midi, ils sont nés le matin, et ils repartent vers deux, trois mois [NDLR : à l’abattoir]. Pendant tout ce temps, il y a eu beaucoup de morts. Ils s'étouffent entre eux pour essayer de se réchauffer, parce que les températures ne sont pas respectées. Donc ils ont froid, ils ont faim, ils meurent étouffés. [...] Les volailles étaient laissées un peu à l'abandon, le patron oubliait parfois de commander l'aliment. L'eau était souvent coupée, on ne comprenait pas pourquoi. »

En 50 jours, plus de 150 canards sont morts. Un taux de mortalité 2,5 fois plus élevé que la moyenne pour ce type d’élevage.

# Deux plaintes déposées 

Nous portons plainte :

* contre l’élevage auprès du procureur de la République du tribunal judiciaire de Laval pour mauvais traitements et abandon d'animaux,

* contre l'abattoir et LDC pour tromperie du consommateur.

D’après Anaïs, LDC est au courant de l’état critique des animaux provenant de cet établissement, mais n’a pas pour autant rompu ni suspendu ses liens commerciaux avec l’élevage.

Nous comptons sur vous pour lui faire passer le message ! LDC doit stopper immédiatement ses liens commerciaux avec cet élevage.

[Je signe la pétition](https://www.l214.com/enquetes/2024/canards-ldc/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_campaign=2024%2F07-canards-ldc)

Ne souhaitant pas passer sous silence les infractions et les souffrances des animaux dont elle a été témoin, Anaïs a aussi porté plainte auprès de la gendarmerie. Une enquête est à priori en cours. Nous la remercions pour son courage et son témoignage.

Merci à vous également d’être à nos côtés pour défendre ces canards,
L’équipe de L214

Avant je vivais dans une région à l'eau dure et j'ai abandonné à cause des traces blanchâtres qui restaient toujours sur la vaisselle. J'ai déménagé dans une région à l'eau assez douce, je me suis remis à en faire et c'est toujours la cata. 

On dirait qu'il manque un ingrédient mystère. J'ai même tenté de mettre un peu de vinaigre à la fin pour rincer mais sans succès.

Ils envisagent d'organiser un séminaire où tout le monde prend l'avion. J'ai ouvert un sondage pour lancer un débat sur un moyen de transport bas carbone. Voilà la réponse que j'ai reçu du fondateur :

>*On arrête déjà l'entreprise pendant \~10 jours pour le séminaire, nous ne pouvons pas nous permettre d'avoir l'équipe en congé pendant quelques jours supplémentaires pour se rendre sur place*

>*Ne pas prendre l'avion n'aide pas à résoudre les problèmes les plus urgents du monde. Trouver une solution pour un carburant durable, développer des sources d'énergie propre, réduire la consommation de carburant des véhicules, et les décarboniser, oui. Ne pas prendre l'avion ne l'empêche pas de voler, de toute façon il vole.*

>*Je te conseille cette lecture intéressante* [*https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/moving-flight-shame-flight-solutions*](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/moving-flight-shame-flight-solutions)

Je ne suis pas assez renseigné pour trouver les meilleurs arguments pour répondre à cet article techno-solutionniste du ""Sierra Club"".

Est ce que vous pouvez m'aider à recueillir un maximum de ressources et d'arguments pour convaincre mon entreprise d'éviter l'avion lors de notre prochain séminaire. Pour l'instant je comptais juste m'appuyer sur cet article de Bon Pote : [Pourquoi arrêter l’avion ne devrait plus être un débat](https://bonpote.com/pourquoi-arreter-lavion-ne-devrait-plus-etre-un-debat/), qui aborde notamment l'argument « Mais de toute façon l’avion il partira que je sois dedans ou pas ! ».

Quantifier les fuites de fluides et leur nocivité/neutralité. Les matériaux entérrés sont ils extraits dans les faits après que le système soit hs? Combien de temps mettra la terre bougée lors de l'installation pour reprendre ses fonctions...?

1dqgm6o,Réalisation d'un documentaire sur le rapport aux plantes,"Bonjour !

En ce début d'été, je commence un court-métrage documentaire sur le thème des plantes et du rapport aux plantes, notamment aux plantes d'intérieur.

Je vais filmer dans les prochaines semaines à Paris, et je suis en recherche de témoignages sur le rapport aux plantes, aux fleurs, aux arbres.

Je cherche une ou deux personnes qui seraient d'accord pour témoigner de l'importance qu'ont les plantes dans leur quotidien, la manière dont ils ou elles s'en occupent, la manière dont les plantes ont été choisies, achetées ou recueillies, etc...

J'ai en tête les plantes d'intérieur, mais je serais très heureux aussi de pouvoir recueillir des témoignages sur le rapport aux plantes et aux fleurs dans les espaces publics (parcs, rues fleuries).

Une inspiration pour ce documentaire a été la lecture de l'Herbier de prison (1915 - 1918) de Rosa Luxembourg, que je vous conseille au passage !

Est-ce que l'un ou l'une d'entre vous serait intéressé par ce projet et éventuellement tenté de témoigner ?

1dit7ih,Non à l'installation d'une ferme-usine de 150 000 poules à Vaugeton !,"Le groupe Pampr’oeuf s’apprête à installer **une ferme usine de 150 000 poules pondeuses dans le village de Vaugeton sur la commune de Celle-Levescault (86). En tant que riverains de cette future exploitation, mais avant tout en tant que citoyen·ne·s, nous nous opposons fermement à un tel projet.**

Le site choisi par le groupe Pampr’oeuf ne doit rien au hasard. Cette « ferme » doit s’installer dans **les bâtiments existants d’une ancienne chèvrerie, elle-même symbole de l’élevage intensif.** Cet élevage caprin fut un temps la plus grande chèvrerie d'Europe, comptant plusieurs milliers de bêtes, enfermées 24h/24. Des poules pondeuses pourraient donc remplacer les chèvres, le tout à moins de 100 mètres des premières habitations!

Cet élevage ne sera pas uniquement destiné à la production et la vente d'œufs. En effet, **les fientes seront vendues pour alimenter des méthaniseurs afin de produire du gaz, et les poules considérées comme insuffisamment productives (c'est-à-dire à l'âge d’un an) seront abattues pour être envoyées sur des marchés étrangers comme viande à bouillir.**

Nous nous opposons fermement à ce projet et réclamons le gel de toute installation sur ce terrain tant que des solutions viables et respectueuses de l’environnement ne sont pas présentées.

Nous considérons en effet que cet élevage ne respectera pas les principes de base du bien-être animal. En effet, **comment considérer que 150 000 poules, entassées dans 4 hangars (soit 8 poules par mètre carré) puissent avoir les comportements naturels propres à cette espèce** : gratter et picorer le sol, prendre des bains de poussière, se percher dans les arbres…? Tout cela est bien entendu inenvisageable dans un tel univers surpeuplé, bien mal nommé « élevage au sol » ou « élevage alternatif » (alternatif… aux cages). Le groupe Pampr'oeuf a par ailleurs été épinglé à plusieurs reprises par l’association de défense du bien-être animal L214 (voir les liens ci-après).

De plus, nous savons que **ces cheptels monstrueux sont responsables de contaminations et présentent des risques sanitaires majeurs.** Ils font aussi planer une menace tant sur les animaux de nos basse-cours que pour les élevages alentours, et sur les personnes (les salariés et les voisins étant en première ligne). L’ONG internationale CIWF estime ainsi que la densité des élevages est **un facteur aggravant de développement de virus pathogènes potentiellement transmissibles aux humains (zoonose), en particulier la grippe aviaire.**

Enfin, contrairement à ce que prétend le porteur de projet, cet élevage industriel de poules pondeuses sera inévitablement **source de nuisances pour le cadre de vie des riverains** : pollution visuelle, sonore (bruit de machines et d’engins), olfactive (odeurs d'ammoniaque attestées par des riverains des installations du même groupe à Pamproux), trafic de camions accru (alors que les infrastructures routières ne sont tout simplement pas adaptées), poussière et risque de présence et de prolifération d'animaux nuisibles…

**Nous voulons un environnement sain pour nos enfants.**

**Nous voulons des paysans respectueux du bien-être des animaux, pas des industriels de l’agro-alimentaire attirés par le profit.**

Alors mobilisons-nous avant qu'il ne soit trop tard!

1dg3iab,Créer une zone de biodiversité maximale,"Bonjour, Je ne sais pas si je suis sur le meilleur sub pour ma question, n'hésitez pas à m'indiquer où poster.

Je cherche des idées, expériences, méthodes etc... pour créer une zone de biodiversité maximal.

  
Un terrain à quelques mètres de chez moi est proposé par la safer. C'est un terrain de 5000m², dans un méandre de la marne (à 15 mètres du cours d'eau) (inondé 1 hiver sur 2), utilisé depuis quelques années par un producteur de légumes en reconversion bio. Mais ce professionnel l'a abandonné, en laissant le film de paillage noir (qui ne semble pas biodégradable...) avant de complétement couler son activité. Il m'avait indiquer l'abandonner car terrain trop humide pour le travailler (argile), le chemin d'accès pas assez large pour le tracteur, pas entretenu....

J'aimerais reprendre ce terrain, le nettoyer de son plastique puis l'aménager avec un objectif de biodiversité maximale (faune/flore). Je ne cherche pas d'exotisme, au contraire, du local seulement. C'est le genre d'endroit ou si on creuse un trou d'1m de profondeur, il sera inondé 10 mois sur 12, peuplé de grenouilles en quelques jours et de poissons dés la première inondation... Je suis conscient que ce n'est que 5000m², je ne vais pas y voir de gros animaux ni d'immense végétaux.

 Je suis preneur de toute idée. J'imagine par exemple les 3 premières années y creuser un trou, peut être une haie autour du terrain, planter/semer des arbres locaux (peut être avec une approche miyawaki)...etc... puis laisser la nature faire le reste. Si je parviens à obtenir une grande biodiversité rapidement, il y aura ensuite un équilibrage naturel

1dfzd5j,Quelles perspectives concrètes à l'urgence écologique ?,"En fait je réalise qu'autour de moi beaucoup de gens ne sont pas dans le même état d'esprit que moi, dans le sens : ils n'ont pas en tête qu'il y a urgence à agir, et surtout que l'on joue gros.

Un exemple, j'ai un ami qui a voté pour un parti sans se demander avant de le faire la teneur de leur programme en matière d'écologie. Une autre personne, proche de moi, revendique qu'elle ne votera jamais pour EELV parce qu'ils sont trop à gauche.

Pour moi, la sauvegarde du vivant et des conditions d'habitabilité de la terre est une priorité absolue. Donc d'une part je me renseigne sur la proposition écolo d'un parti avant de voter pour lui, et d'autre part je passe outre les mesures que je pourrais trouver plus contestables de EELV, parce que de toute façon, ce sont eux qui auront le plus à cœur de défendre les intérêts écolos et que c'est cela le plus important (je me base sur l'historique de leurs votes au parlement européen et sur l'analyse de leur programme par Reporterre).

Je pense que ces deux personnes ne réalisent pas ce qui est en train de se jouer. Et pas qu'elles deux ; je vois des tas de personnes qui ne se font aucun souci pour l'avenir de l'humanité et n'agissent en rien en conséquence.

Je suis en train de mettre cela en lien avec la capacité d'abstraction de chacun ; comment intégrer un danger, une menace, qui est évoquée parfois par les médias mais pas ressentie par l'individu même ? Les scientifiques évoquent la terrifiante augmentation de 5° mais dit comme cela c'est risible, je ne sais pas s'ils réalisent.

Moi je crois que l'on manque de « catastrophisme », pour que ça bouge. J'aimerais avoir plus de scénarios concrets terrifiants et légitimes en même temps ; que des publications sérieuses « osent » se projeter et imaginer en quoi, concrètement, ce serait si problématique que cela de ne pas changer nos habitiudes en 2024.

Avez-vous des contenus à partager qui soient à la fois percutants et crédibles, sérieux, sur les catastrophes qui nous attendent si l'on continue dans la voie sur laquelle on est lancé ?

Avez-vous vécu vous aussi des expériences de frustration et de solitude avec des proches qui considèrent les enjeux écologiques comme secondaires ?",20,40,2024-06-14 15:41:22,fr,ecologie

Nombre d’espèce nuisibles français (nuisible pour l’écosystème français )
Sont tout à fais comestibles 

«La belette, la fouine, la martre, le putois, le renard, le corbeau freux, la corneille, l'étourneau sansonnet, le ragondin, le geai des chênes et la pie bavarde »

En ce qui concerne la vie aquatique, je n'ai pas trouvé autant d'espèces. Pourriez-vous me donner votre avis sur d'éventuelles espèces invasives oubliées de votre part?

«le poisson chat,la perche soleil, ainsi que l’écrevisse de floride accompagné de tortue de floride»

Personnellement, j'imaginerais bien manger tout ça, mais je sais que pour le ragondin, il n'est pas possible de le manger. On m'a dit qu'il y a trop de fer dans le sang. 

Est-ce que chacune de ces espèces est impure et la consommation humaine?

Est ce que ce ne serais pas des idées reçu ou des meurs différente au pays d’origine des espèces nuisibles 

Exemple les tortue de floride étais manger bien avant qu’elle n’arrive en France aujourd’hui si il étais aussi simple de manger l’es espèce nuisible serais une chance pour le français pauvre repas gratuit ou presque

Je pense que d’énorme piège à tortue ou beaucoup de petit piege pourrais donner lieux à des repas caritatifs pendant l’es saison de prolifération des nuisibles pour stopper pour éradiquer leur présence dévastatrice

À l’origine de la formation de l’Union européenne, il y a bien sûr des intérêts économiques, mais également une volonté de s’unir autour de principes et de droits fondamentaux communs. Dès 1973, la protection de l’environnement devient un enjeu majeur avec le lancement du premier programme d’action pour l’environnement, où celui-ci est considéré comme “une donnée indissociable de l’organisation et de la promotion du progrès humain”. De nombreuses directives emblématiques ont suivi, telles que la directive Habitats, la directive Oiseaux et la directive-cadre sur la qualité de l’air.

Aujourd’hui, le Pacte vert européen, lancé en 2019, constitue un pilier central du mandat d’Ursula von der Leyen. Son objectif est de faire de l’Union européenne un acteur majeur de la transition énergétique et climatique, notamment en devenant le premier continent à atteindre la neutralité carbone d’ici 2050.

# Le Pacte vert européen : une avancée à consolider dans un contexte qui a fortement évolué depuis 2019

Le Pacte vert européen s’est traduit par plus de 60 législations sectorielles ou transversales1 depuis son lancement. Les trois quarts des textes annoncés en 2019 ont été adoptés, mais de grandes disparités sectorielles sont à déplorer. Certains domaines comme l’agriculture, la biodiversité et la pollution chimique ont vu un bilan moins convaincant, contrairement aux législations concernant l’énergie et les transports qui, présentées dans la première moitié du mandat, sont allées à leur terme de manière générale. Les textes pour verdir les pratiques agricoles, dont un tiers des initiatives promises a été concrétisé, ont fait l’objet d’attaques de plus en plus virulentes, à l’instar du règlement pour la restauration de la nature.

Malgré les attaques en crescendo contre le Pacte vert européen, voici quelques exemples de textes et leurs statuts classés par pilier, la liste complète est [disponible ici](https://docs.google.com/file/d/1YX4WJnHFQpt3ueepkHvsXw-IqLy9USvF/edit?amp;filetype=msexcel)

**Actions climatiques (8 adoptés, 1 en cours)**

* Loi climat

* Création d’un mécanisme d’ajustement carbone aux frontières (CBAM)

* Révision du marché du carbone

* Révision du règlement partage de l’effort

* Révision de la directive sur l’efficacité énergétique

* Révision du règlement sur les puits de carbone naturel (LULUCF)

* Révision du règlement sur les émissions de CO2 des véhicules légers

* Règlement sur la certification des absorptions de carbone

* Révision de la directive sur les données environnementales géospatiales (en cours)

**Énergie « propre, abordable et sûre » (3 adoptés, 1 presque fini, 1 en cours)**

* Révision de la directive RED sur les énergies renouvelables

* Révision de la directive sur la performance énergétique des bâtiments

* Revoir le cadre législatif afin de concevoir un marché du gaz décarboné (paquet gazier)

* Révision du règlement RTE-E pour adapter les réseaux transeuropéens d’énergie à la décarbonation (en attente de l’accord formel du Conseil de l’UE avant publication)

* Révision de la directive sur la taxation de l’énergie (en cours)

**Une économie « propre et circulaire » (4 adoptés, 4 presque finis, 4 encours et 2 fichus)**

**Mobilité « durable et intelligente » (9 adoptés, 4 presque finis, 5 en cours, 2 fichus)**

**Verdissement de la Politique agricole commune (3 adoptés, 3 presque finis, 3 en cours, 8 fichus)**

**Préservation et protection de la biodiversité (4 adoptés, 1 presque finis, 4 en cours, 1, pas clair, 1 fichu)**

**Tendre vers le « zéro pollution » (4 adoptés, 4 presque finis, 5 en cours, 4 fichus)**

**Intégration de la durabilité dans toutes les politiques (3 adoptés, 3 presque finis)**

# Quelle suite pour le Pacte vert européen ?

Depuis l’adoption du Pacte vert pour l’Europe, le paysage politique a connu une profonde mutation. Si la mobilisation de la société civile et des mouvements écologistes, de même que la reconnaissance des défis environnementaux auxquels nous faisons face à l’échelle européenne et mondiale, demeurent intacts, force est de constater un changement de priorités. La pandémie de Covid-19, les conflits armés en Ukraine et au Moyen-Orient, l’exacerbation de la rivalité sino-américaine, la nécessité pour l’Europe de garantir sa souveraineté technologique et en ressources, les enjeux de sécurité alimentaire et de pouvoir d’achat, tous ces facteurs ont contribué à redistribuer les cartes.

Le débat actuel au Parlement européen sur les tentatives de l’extrême droite et des conservateurs d’amoindrir ce pacte met en lumière l’importance des enjeux climatiques et environnementaux dans la prochaine mandature. Les nouveaux eurodéputés auront le pouvoir de maintenir ou de changer le cap sur des mesures cruciales, telles que la fixation des objectifs de réduction des émissions d’ici à 2040 (objectif à 2030 : -55% par rapport à 1990 avec le Fit for 55), la fin des ventes de véhicules neufs à moteur thermique d’ici 2035, ou la part des énergies renouvelables dans la consommation européenne au-delà de 2030 (objectif 2030 : 42,5% alors que pour la France, cette part n’était que de 19,1% en 2020 en dessous des 23% prévus par l’UE hors nucléaire). Cependant, alors que la question de la proportion de réglementations issues du droit européen en France varie selon les secteurs et suscite des débats (environ 40% en agriculture et 80% en environnement), **l’environnement ne figure pas au premier plan de la campagne électorale française.**

Enfin, ces élections sont l’un des rares moments où les citoyens européens ont l’occasion de s’exprimer tous ensemble. En effet, ils élisent directement leurs représentants au Parlement européen, et leur choix déterminera la composition des sept groupes politiques qui y siègent, lesquels regroupent près de 260 partis politiques nationaux.

C’est un rendez-vous incontournable qu’il ne faut donc pas manquer ! Aux urnes citoyens !

Le changement climatique est un défi mondial crucial avec des implications profondes pour les systèmes économiques. Au cours des dernières décennies, de nombreuses preuves scientifiques ont souligné l'urgence de faire face aux changements environnementaux accélérés dus aux activités humaines. La hausse des températures mondiales, les événements météorologiques extrêmes et les changements dans les régimes de précipitations posent d'importants risques pour les économies du monde entier, affectant directement et indirectement la production économique, la productivité et le bien-être social. En particulier, ces changements climatiques influencent divers secteurs de l'économie, de l'agriculture et de l'énergie aux infrastructures et à la santé, affectant finalement le produit intérieur brut (PIB) aux niveaux régional, national et mondial.

Des études récentes ont exploré la relation entre le changement climatique et le PIB, révélant des effets complexes et variés. Par exemple, les régions fortement dépendantes des secteurs sensibles au climat, comme l'agriculture et le tourisme, sont touchées de manière disproportionnée par les variations de température et les changements météorologiques ([Burke et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15725)). De plus, les événements météorologiques extrêmes tels que les ouragans, les inondations et les sécheresses perturbent les activités économiques, entraînant des pertes significatives de productivité et de revenus ([Hsiang & Jina, 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13278)). De plus, l'impact à long terme de la hausse des températures sur la productivité du travail et la santé impose des fardeaux supplémentaires à la croissance économique ([Dell et al., 2012](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.50.3.686)).

Au-delà des impacts spécifiques aux secteurs, le changement climatique pose également des défis macroéconomiques. Les changements dans la demande énergétique, les modifications des schémas commerciaux et les migrations dues aux déplacements liés au climat peuvent déstabiliser les économies, en particulier dans les régions en développement ayant une capacité d'adaptation limitée ([Burke et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15725)). En outre, les coûts économiques de l'atténuation et de l'adaptation au changement climatique représentent un fardeau fiscal important, susceptible d'évincer d'autres investissements publics.

Cet article vise à contribuer au corpus croissant de la littérature en examinant les effets multiformes du changement climatique sur le PIB. Nous passerons en revue les études existantes pour identifier les principaux canaux par lesquels le changement climatique affecte la production économique et analyserons la répartition des impacts entre les différentes régions et groupes de revenus. Ce faisant, nous souhaitons fournir une compréhension globale des risques économiques associés au changement climatique et offrir des perspectives politiques pour améliorer la résilience et la capacité d'adaptation face à un avenir climatique incertain.

### Objectifs :
1. Analyser les effets directs et indirects du changement climatique sur le PIB.
2. Évaluer les variations sectorielles et régionales des impacts économiques.
3. Explorer les implications politiques pour atténuer et s'adapter au changement climatique.",8,3,2024-05-10 07:15:17,fr,ecologie

1cgz39c,Les chargeurs publiques sont ils rentable ou très rentable ? ,"Bonjour a tous, 

En lisant un article sur les chargeurs publiques pour voiture électrique je me poses des questions.

J'apprends que le prix d'installation d'une borne 22kw est de 10k€. Pour les rapides 150kw c'est 40000€ Une fortune pourrait on pensé à première vue mais un rapide calcul me fait penser le contraire.

Admettons que notre opérateur facture le kWh avec 10cent de marge sur le prix EDF 20 ct/kWh -facture 30 au client.
Notre borne rapide va injecter 70kwh en moyenne les 150kw sont le max theorique. Et son occupation est relativement faible seulement 10% du temps. 
Une voiture qui reste une heur paie donc hors frais additionnels. 70*0,3=21€/h mais seulement 7€ finise en bénéfice avant charge et impôt.
Sur une journée de 24h avec 10% d'utilisation on peut espérer gagner 7€*2,4 ~ 17€ la journée.
Au bout d'une am on aura donc gagné 6200€ 
La rentabilité est donc atteint au bout de 7 année a condition que la maintenance reste faible et qu il n'y a pas de dégradation. 

Maintenant regardons un peut plus prêt les prix observé sur différentes borne public.

Sur autoroute, le prix varie entre 39ct et 60ct, sur les prises en ville on est plus entre du 20 ct et du 40ct.

Le coût de l'électricité est très variable sur le marché spot et a termes donc je reste avec un prix théorique de 20ct même si au vu que certains chargeur public facture ce prix il semble qu'il arrive à se fournir en électricité bien moins cher.

Donc dans le cas d'une charge a 39ct le gain potentiel devient de 11780€ par an. Et pour les chargeur a 60ct 24800€ par an.

Est ce que les coûts de maintenance sont très élevé ou est ce que les opérateurs se font des couilles en or.

Le Haut conseil pour le climat et la biodiversité, installé début 2023 par Christian Estrosi, a remis au président de la Métropole Nice Côte d’Aazur son premier rapport. Il contient 167 propositions pour faire face aux défis et enjeux d’aujourd’hui et de demain.

Installé en 2023 par Christian Estrosi, le Haut conseil pour le climat et la biodiversité a remis son premier rapport au président de la Métropole.

Un an après sa création, le Haut conseil pour le climat et la biodiversité de la Métropole a rendu son premier rapport au président Christian Estrosi. Les dix-sept experts et scientifiques, tous bénévoles, ont listé 167 propositions ""à mettre en place sur le court, moyen et long terme"", a souligné leur présidente Damienne Provitolo.

Christian Estrosi a assuré que ""près de 80% de ces propositions sont déjà en œuvre. Il en reste une cinquantaine à mettre en œuvre et je me suis engagé à le faire."" Et, s’adressant aux experts venus en mairie lui remettre ce rapport: ""Je vous demande de nous le rappeler, y compris médiatiquement, si nous faisions défaut.""

Le Haut conseil a constitué quatre groupes de travail pour plancher sur ""les événements climatiques extrêmes"", ""la gestion des ressources en énergie et alimentation"", ""l’aménagement du territoire et la biodiversité"" et ""la mobilisation de la population et des acteurs locaux"".

Des préconisations très diverses
Concrètement, bien des propositions semblent frappées au coin du bon sens: ""réduire l’artificialisation des sols et maîtriser l’étalement urbain"", ""favoriser les plantations adaptées à l’évolution climatique"" ou encore ""promouvoir les parcours ombragés"".

Parmi les pistes, quelques-unes ne semblent ni compliquées ni coûteuses, comme ""adapter les horaires des parcs et jardins pour que la population puisse s’y rafraîchir le soir"", quand d’autres risquent de se heurter à la réalité, comme ""renforcer les itinéraires des pistes cyclables sur les collines niçoises"" où les voies sont souvent très étroites.

De nombreuses idées des experts, plus techniques, ne parleront qu’à un public averti: ""créer un PLUm bioclimatique"", ""consolider nos connaissances sur l’évolution du biseau salé"" ou encore ""travailler les synergies avec les acteurs de l’aménagement du territoire"".

Enfin, une poignée de préconisations ne manqueront pas de faire bondir les opposants à Christian Estrosi. Par exemple: ""considérer l’impact environnemental des projets d’extension des infrastructures aéroportuaires"", ""revoir la tarification des transports en commun pour la rendre incitative"" ou encore ""protéger les terres agricoles"" et ""préempter des terrains pour du foncier alimentaire"".

Avant de tester des idées, je veux me remettre à la page sur le problème, et où on en est en France : comprendre les chiffres, les plans d'action, ce qui va et ne va pas, etc.

J'essaie de mettre cet état des lieux par écrit [ici](https://ltrq.substack.com/).

Pour l'instant c'est uniquement une façon de mettre au clair ce qu'il y a dans ma tête, et je serai **très intéressé par des retours** de gens sensibilisés au sujet, et sûrement plus calés que moi 😁.

Bonjour

Des vaches et des veaux frappés avec rage, égorgés sans étourdissement, encore conscients après la saignée et jusqu’à leur suspension… Les images effroyables que nous dévoilons aujourd’hui proviennent de l’abattoir Bigard de Venarey-les-Laumes en Côte-d’Or.

**Notre enquête montre l’abattage sans étourdissement des animaux selon les rituels halal et casher, et des actes de violence délibérée.**

Les animaux paniquent, se débattent et se vident de leur sang durant de très longues minutes avant de perdre conscience. **Leur souffrance est indescriptible.**

Cet abattoir produit **chaque jour 60 tonnes de viande**, vendue à la fois sous certifications halal et casher, et dans le circuit classique –aussi bien en grandes surfaces, entre autres sous la marque Bigard, que dans des boucheries artisanales.

[Signez la pétition pour demander la fermeture de cet abattoir et la fin de l’abattage sans étourdissement.](https://www.l214.com/enquetes/2024/abattoir-bigard/)

[SIGNER LA PÉTITION](https://www.l214.com/enquetes/2024/abattoir-bigard/)

# Des animaux suspendus conscients, la gorge béante

Lors des abattages sans étourdissement, les animaux sont poussés dans un box rotatif qui les retourne sur le dos, puis sont saignés à vif. La majorité d’entre eux sont égorgés par un geste de cisaillement, alors que la saignée doit être effectuée en un seul passage de lame et en un seul geste pour éviter d'intenses souffrances, comme c'est le cas ici.

Les animaux sont relâchés du box juste après l'égorgement, alors que l’immobilisation doit être maintenue jusqu’à l’état d’inconscience. Ils montrent des signes de conscience évidents : redressement du haut du corps, tentative de se mettre debout, clignement des yeux, mouvements volontaires. Certains sont en panique totale.

# L214 demande la fin de l’abattage sans étourdissement

L’abattage des animaux est encadré par la réglementation européenne. Les animaux doivent être mis à mort après étourdissement, mais une dérogation à l’obligation d’étourdissement est prévue pour le marché halal et casher.

Cette dérogation est facultative dans chaque législation nationale. Au Danemark, en Norvège, en Finlande, en Suède, au Luxembourg ou encore en Belgique (hors région Bruxelles-Capitale), les animaux sont étourdis avant l’abattage rituel.

Les souffrances supplémentaires induites par ce mode d’abattage font consensus auprès des principales institutions vétérinaires. C’est pourquoi nous demandons au ministère de l’Agriculture la fin de cette dérogation. Et vous ?

# L214 porte plainte contre l’abattoir et exige sa fermeture en urgence

Comme si ces horreurs ne suffisaient pas, des animaux sont frappés dans l’enclos d’attente avant d’être abattus. Une vache subit l’acharnement d’un ouvrier, qui la bat avec rage et lui enfonce son bâton dans l’anus. Elle reçoit plus de 20 coups violents en une minute.

Nous portons plainte contre l’abattoir pour sévices graves et actes de cruauté auprès du procureur du tribunal judiciaire de Dijon.

Vu les graves dysfonctionnements, nous demandons au préfet de la Côte-d’Or la suspension immédiate de l’agrément d’abattage de cet abattoir, . C’est le seul moyen de protéger les animaux prévus à l’abattage ces prochains jours. Merci d’appuyer cette demande en signant la pétition.

Quel que soit le mode d’abattage, tous les abattoirs sont des lieux d'extrême violence pour les animaux. Ne l’oublions pas.

Merci d’agir pour les animaux,
L’équipe de L214

1bu92sn,Hydrogène : le pari français se frotte au réel,"Une première. Avant ce 8 septembre 2020, la France n’avait jamais osé dégainer un plan industriel de 7 milliards d’euros sur dix ans, avec une rallonge de 2 milliards un an plus tard grâce au plan de relance post-Covid. L'objectif ? Faire émerger, quasiment ex nihilo, une filière hydrogène capable de jouer à armes égales avec l’Allemagne, sans dépendre de la Chine. À l’instar des Coréens dans le numérique ou des Japonais dans la robotique. Pas question cette fois de se laisser guider par Bruxelles ou Berlin, comme ce fut le cas dans les renouvelables.

Avec sa stratégie nationale pour le développement de l’hydrogène bas carbone, le ministre de l’Économie Bruno Le Maire proposait une voie française et assumait des choix clairs, quitte à faire quelques mécontents. D’ici à 2023, 3,4 milliards d’euros devaient ainsi être engagés dans la fabrication d’électrolyseurs destinés à la production locale avec de l’électricité nucléaire d’hydrogène bas carbone, afin de réduire les émissions de CO2 de l’industrie et de la mobilité lourde.

# Une vingtaine de sites développés en trois ans

De quoi placer l’Hexagone dans le peloton de tête de la course mondiale au développement de cette molécule, la plus légère du tableau périodique des éléments chimiques de Mendeleïev, à la fois carburant et vecteur énergétique, indispensable complément à l’électricité pour sortir des énergies fossiles.

Contrairement au plan allemand annoncé quelques mois plus tôt (également de 9 milliards d’euros) ou au plan japonais lancé dès 2017, le plan français ne prévoyait ni infrastructures, ni importation d’hydrogène vert de pays bénéficiant de larges ressources en soleil ou en vent, ou d’hydrogène bleu de pays producteurs de gaz naturel, ni exportation des technologies, et rien sur le stockage des renouvelables. À l’époque, hormis un gisement au Mali, personne ne croyait à l’hydrogène naturel. La France, grâce à son nucléaire et à ses industriels, devait pouvoir produire localement l’hydrogène bas carbone dont elle aurait besoin, sans répéter le scénario de la filière photovoltaïque, dépendante des panneaux chinois.

Force est de constater, trois ans et demi plus tard, que ce plan n’a pas si mal fonctionné. Grâce à la mise en place d’un projet important d’intérêt européen commun (Pieec) hydrogène, permettant de déplafonner les subventions à l’industrie, et au dynamisme des acteurs français : sur les 40 dossiers de l’appel à projets Hy2Tech retenus par Bruxelles, 10 étaient français. Le gouvernement a ainsi pu mobiliser 2,7 milliards d’euros en trois ans pour développer une vingtaine d’usines d’équipements ou de lignes de production, couvrant quasiment toute la chaîne de valeur.

«*La France est l’un des seuls pays au monde à avoir l’intégralité des briques technologiques, observe Géraldine Lemblé, la directrice générale adjointe de Medef International. L’hydrogène est notre filière la plus active.*» De nouvelles usines, principalement dédiées au véhicule utilitaire, ont été construites, alors que ce n’étaient pas la priorité du plan français. Hyvia (coentreprise de Renault et Plug) et Symbio (coentreprise de Michelin et Forvia) ont inauguré leur site de production de piles à combustible respectivement en mars 2022 et décembre 2023, et Forvia son usine de réservoirs d’hydrogène en octobre 2023. Parallèlement, trois fabricants de stations d’avitaillement, Atawey, HRS et MCPhy, développaient leur outil industriel et levaient des fonds en Bourse.

# Loin de l’objectif des 10 GW en 2035

Le Pieec hydrogène a aussi permis de lancer la construction de quatre gigafactories d’électrolyseurs, celles de McPhy, de Genvia, d’Elogen et de John Cockerill, et de lignes de production de membranes chez Arkema. Une seconde vague du Pieec devrait valider les projets de gigafactories de Gen’Hy ou de HDF Energy, qui veut développer des piles à combustible géantes (1 MW), pour le stockage stationnaire des renouvelables ou le maritime.

Par ailleurs, les appels à projets pour des écosystèmes territoriaux d’hydrogène de l’Ademe ont permis de faire émerger 46 projets dans 30 territoires, y compris en Outre-mer, représentant 80 MW de capacité de production d’hydrogène local pour alimenter des bennes à ordures ou des bus... C’est peu. Mais grâce à l’appel à projets Hy2Use du Pieec, qui a déjà permis de valider et financer le projet Normand’Hy d’Air Liquide (200 MW à Port-Jérôme), mais pas encore de déclencher le finacement de Masshylia, celui de TotalEnergies et Engie (120 MW à La Mède), ce sont près de 1,4 à 1,8 GW de production massive d’hydrogène pour l’industrie, qui pourrait émerger, indique le lobby du secteur, France Hydrogène, dans son bilan de juin 2023.

C’est bien, mais encore loin des 6,5 GW prévus dans la stratégie pour 2030 et des 10 GW nécessaires pour produire des carburants de synthèse pour l’aérien et le maritime en 2035. On est loin aussi des 2 à 3 GW que l’ex-Première ministre, Élisabeth Borne, annonçait comme sécurisés dans sa présentation, le 15 décembre dernier, de la révision de la stratégie nationale hydrogène en consultation. Or les 4 milliards d’euros sur dix ans du plan hydrogène, que le gouvernement met sur la table pour un mécanisme de soutien à la production, ne couvriront que l’installation de 1 GW d’électrolyse compétitive. De toute façon, la demande n’est pas encore au rendez-vous. 

Du côté des transports lourds, camions ou trains, les batteries électriques n’ont pas dit leur dernier mot. «*La filière est au milieu du gué. C’est bien beau d’avoir subventionné le développement de gigafactories pour d’hydrogène par le mécanisme de soutien, mais il faut aussi faire quelque chose sur la demande*», rappelle Philippe Boucly, le président de France Hydrogène, qui réclame 700 à 800 millions d’euros pour développer les stations hydrogène et subventionner l’achat de véhicules hydrogène.

# Le marché n'est pas encore prêt

Dans l’industrie, la demande se fait également attendre. «Le marché est moins mûr qu’on ne le pensait», constate Catherine MacGregor, la directrice générale d’Engie, qui reconnaît avoir abandonné certains projets. Le marché de la décarbonation des industries les plus émettrices de gaz à effet de serre comme celle de l’acier, la première visée par la stratégie française, n’est pas prêt. Selon elle, «les applications qui vont décoller le plus vite sont celles qui existent déjà, avec de l’hydrogène gris qu’on replace par du vert, comme la production d’ammoniac».

De plus, le passage à l’échelle des électrolyseurs pour des unités de plusieurs dizaines de gigawatts ne se fait pas aussi facilement qu’annoncé par les industriels. «Il y a aussi la question de la maturité des équipements et de vrais sujets d’industrialisation des électrolyseurs», ajoute la directrice générale d’Engie. Ce qu’est bien obligé d’admettre Philippe Boucly, qui tempère en expliquant que les électrolyseurs chinois, eux aussi, sont loin des performances attendues.

Et c’est sans parler des incertitudes des opérateurs sur les prix de l’électricité, sachant qu’il va représenter plus de la moitié des coûts de production de l’hydrogène par électrolyse. L’accord sur la régulation des prix de l’électricité post-Arenh (Accès régulé à l’électricité nucléaire historique) passé entre le gouvernement et EDF ne leur assure pas assez de visibilité. «*La clé, c’est d’avoir de l’électricité décarbonée en abondance. Mais à 100 euros le mégawattheure, il n’y aura pas d’hydrogène en France, prévient Philippe Boucly. Entre 50 et 70 euros, et si le prix des électrolyseurs baisse, cela devrait passer.*»

# L'impossible souveraineté française dans l'hydrogène

Or la France n’est pas isolée. La Chine, qui détient 50% des capacités de production d’électrolyse dans le monde est la mieux placée pour baisser les prix. Surtout, plus de 40 pays dans le monde ont dévoilé une feuille de route hydrogène, dont certains avec de très fortes ambitions d’exportation, comme les États-Unis, l’Arabie saoudite, l’Australie, le Chili, le Maroc ou la Norvège. Forçant la France à finalement envisager, elle aussi, l’option de l’importation d’hydrogène vert ou de ses dérivés, comme l’ammoniac, plus facile à transporter. Dans sa stratégie révisée, le gouvernement reconnaît que «le recours aux importations d’hydrogène décarboné à moyen terme pourrait présenter des opportunités en complément de la production nationale, dans une économie ouverte». 

Les premiers flux ne sont pas attendus avant 2030 et ne devraient véritablement se développer que dans les années 2040 avec les premières infrastructures de transport intercontinentales. Pour y voir plus clair, l’État a chargé l’Inspection générale des finances et celle de l’Environnement et du Développement durable ainsi que le Conseil général de l’économie d’analyser «l’opportunité et les modalités d’importation» d’hydrogène en France. Leurs conclusions doivent être rendues au premier trimestre.

Conscient que les industriels français ne peuvent pas attendre que se développe la demande nationale, l’État se résout à copier l’Allemagne et va développer une véritable diplomatie hydrogène française à l’international. Il mobilisera tous les dispositifs existants d’aide à l’export (prêt du Trésor et de l’Agence française de développement, accompagnement de Business France...) et créera, dans le courant de l’année, une subvention aux investissements permettant de soutenir directement l’installation d’équipements français. Si les aides publiques directes resteront réservées à la production nationale, l’idée d’une France totalement souveraine en hydrogène semble avoir définitivement vécu.

# Des infrastructures de réseaux à développer

Le développement des infrastructures de transport et de stockage d’hydrogène fut un impensé de la stratégie nationale hydrogène de 2020. Sa révision en 2024 devrait y remédier. Le texte prévoit la construction de 500 km de canalisations dédiées à l’hydrogène gazeux à l’horizon 2030 au sein des quatre principaux hubs de production massive d’hydrogène dans les zones industrielles bas carbone de Fos-sur-Mer, Dunkerque, Havre-Estuaire de la Seine et la Vallée de la chimie, et pour les connecter aux sites de stockage. Ces derniers seront installés sous terre, dans des cavités salines, déjà utilisées pour le stockage de gaz naturel par Storengy, la filiale d’Engie. 

Cette dernière a d’ailleurs, avec l’aide de fonds européens, inauguré un premier site pilote de stockage d’hydrogène, Hypster, sur son site d’Etrez (Ain) en septembre dernier. Les autres sites utilisables se trouvent dans l’Est, le Sud-Est et le Sud-Ouest. Soit loin des hubs hydrogène de Normandie et du Nord. «Mais il faudra plus que 500 km pour connecter l’ensemble de ces hubs avec les stockages», explique Geoffroy Anger, le responsable développement transport H2 et CO2 chez GRTgaz. Le seul projet Hysow de Teréga, pour relier le port de Bordeaux et le pôle aéronautique de Toulouse aux sites de stockage de Lacq, nécessite 600 km de canalisations.

Or connecter les hubs de production aux zones de stockage va s’avérer indispensable pour assurer la résilience du système électrique. Une étude de RTE et GRTgaz de 2023 montre en effet que les 6,5 GW de capacité d’électrolyse prévus en 2030 peuvent être considérés comme des opérateurs d’effacement pour le réseau électrique si on les relie à du stockage. Cette stratégie pourrait permettre au système électrique français d’économiser 1,5 milliard d’euros par an. Le gouvernement a mandaté la Commission de régulation de l’énergie pour définir un tracé et les grandes orientations du cadre de régulation et de soutien à ces infrastructures. Elle doit rendre sa copie en 2026. Trop tard, pour les acteurs du secteur.

«Il est urgent de planifier les besoins en infrastructure. Le développement des infrastructures est relativement long», rappelle Geoffroy Anger. D’autant plus qu’il faut aussi avancer sur le sujet de la dorsale hydrogène, qui devra acheminer, via la France, l’hydrogène vert produit dans la péninsule ibérique et l’Afrique du Nord vers l’Allemagne. Le gouvernement veut faire payer les utilisateurs. L’Europe, elle, considère ces projets comme d’intérêt commun, notamment les cinq qui sont portés par GRTgaz. Le premier, Mosahyc, visant à exporter de l’hydrogène de Moselle vers la Sarre par conversion d’anciennes canalisations de gaz, n’attend plus que la décision finale d’investissement pour être lancé. L’ère des infrastructures hydrogène a commencé.

Basé sur [le dernier rapport](https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-03943821) multidisciplinaire de l'institut, ce [nouveau papier](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(24)00380-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2589004224003808%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) revient sur ce que doit apporter l'édition génomique de variétés dans le cadre de la transition écologique.

Il faudrait cibler des gènes prioritairement afin :

1. d'augmenter le répertoire des espèces.
2. d'identifier ce qui permet d'augmenter l'efficience et la tolérance des plantes dans le cadre d'une meilleure résistance au changement climatique.
3. de sélectionner de nouvelles caractéristiques pour les plantes dites ""de service"" et des cultures associées.
4. de développer des variétés adaptés aux changements des pratiques.

Les chercheurs notent aussi les freins limitant ce développement : connaissance de chaque allèle et des structures des plantes, certaines plantes ne se prêtent que peu à cette édition,  résistance du consommateur.

Est rappelé en conclusion : ""Dans tous les cas, il est essentiel de sortir des promesses entourant cette technologie afin de reconnaitre que la réponse aux défis de transitions vers un système durable ne peut reposer que sur une seule technologie, mais va devoir reposer sur une combinaison de leviers qui nécessitent la mobilisation des sciences biologiques, agronomiques et sociales.""",12,8,2024-03-25 17:43:44,fr,ecologie

Selon Les Echos, il salue l'explosion de la vente des SUV.   

C'est une excellente chose selon lui. 

>*« Nous ne l'avions pas crié sur les toits, mais nous avons misé sur les SUV depuis dix ans. Parce qu'il s'agit de pièces plus grandes, plus compliquées, plus chères. Aujourd'hui, les ventes SUV pèsent 55 % de nos ventes »*, s'enthousiasme Laurent Burelle

Bonjour

C'est avec une joie non dissimulée que nous vous annonçons cette bonne nouvelle : **le préfet du Morbihan ferme l'élevage dont nous avons dévoilée des images choquantes hier.**

Des cochons amaigris, blessés, mutilés, malades, morts ou agonisant dans leurs excréments, des mangeoires contenant des morceaux de corps, le tout dans un bâtiment en ruine. À mi-chemin entre un mouroir et une maison hantée, sauf qu’il s’agit d’un élevage français.

Dans la foulée de notre enquête, **les services de l’État et de gendarmerie se sont rendus sur place hier pour constater la situation.** Et ce matin, le préfet du Morbihan a pris un arrêté pour suspendre les activités de l’élevage.

De son côté, le procureur du parquet de Vannes a ouvert **une enquête judiciaire suite à notre plainte pour mauvais traitements sur les animaux.**

Enquêter, alerter les médias et agir en justice sont des actions indispensables pour changer la vie des animaux. Des actions qui portent leurs fruits et qui dépendent du soutien financier de nos membres. Un grand merci à toutes les personnes qui soutiennent notre travail avec un don.

1b8np7n,L’horreur dans un élevage de cochons fournissant E.Leclerc,"# Cadavres à la pelle, animaux en souffrance et installations délabrées
Bonjour 

 L214 révèle ce jour des images terribles, filmées dans un élevage de cochons du Morbihan, en Bretagne.

Cette exploitation est dans un état absolument catastrophique :

   * des cochons sont à l’agonie dans leurs déjections ;
   * des cadavres sont abandonnés aux quatre coins de l’élevage, certains momifiés ;
   * des morceaux de corps (membres, viscères, os) se retrouvent jusque dans les mangeoires ;
   * des truies en cage sont entourées de leurs petits décédés, des sondes d’insémination artificielle sont laissées dans leur système reproducteur ;
   * des animaux sont très amaigris, blessés ou malades (diarrhées, hernies, abcès, plaies…) ;
   * les bâtiments sont en ruine, l’atmosphère est viciée et l'environnement insalubre.

Ces cochons sont notamment tués dans un abattoir qui approvisionne **plus de 1 400 magasins et drives E.Leclerc**. Non, vous ne rêvez pas : la viande issue de ces animaux est vendue dans l’enseigne « préférée et la plus fréquentée » par les Français et les Françaises !

[E.LECLERC, STOP À CETTE CRUAUTÉ](https://www.l214.com/enquetes/2024/cochons-leclerc/)

Nous avons sollicité un rendez-vous avec E.Leclerc, et nous avons besoin de vous pour appuyer notre demande.

[Pouvez-vous signer notre pétition ?](https://www.l214.com/enquetes/2024/cochons-leclerc/) **E.Leclerc doit cesser de s’approvisionner dans cet élevage, et s’engager à respecter les critères du Pig Minimum Standards contre les pires pratiques d’élevage.**

# La préfecture au courant depuis mai 2022

Depuis 2022, l’élevage a fait l’objet de 3 contrôles du service environnement de la DDPP rattaché à la préfecture du Morbihan. Des non-conformités concernant le traitement des effluents, le suivi sanitaire et la propreté des locaux ont été relevées.

Un arrêté préfectoral de mise en demeure a même été pris en juillet 2023. En vain. L’éleveur ignore purement et simplement les demandes de mise en conformité adressées par l’administration. Les animaux restent dans la détresse.

**La solution ? La fermeture administrative immédiate de cet élevage**, que nous demandons au préfet du Morbihan.

# L214 porte plainte

Nous portons plainte pour mauvais traitements et atteinte à l’environnement auprès du procureur du tribunal judiciaire de Vannes.

Mais vous le savez, le temps de la justice est long. Faites bouger E.Leclerc en attendant !

On trouve beaucoup de personnes opposées au nucléaire sur ce sub. Connaissiez-vous l'existence de cette ressource documentaire ? Si oui, y êtes-vous abonné ? Si vous découvrez son existence, envisageriez-vous de vous y abonner ? Quelles seraient vos raisons pour ne pas vouloir recevoir ce type de documentation ?

(Je précise à toute fin utile que je ne suis pas et n'ai jamais été de quelque manière lié à l'ASN, ni à l'industrie nucléaire de près ou de loin. Je suis juste un ancien militant anti-nucléaire qui a découvert il y a quelques années déjà une ressource documentaire intéressante qui semblent très largement ignorée, volontairement ou non, par mes anciens compagnons de lutte)

&#x200B;

Difficile de trouver des infos un peu béton sur Internet par rapport à ça, donc je préfère me tourner vers les vrais humains de Reddit.

Depuis pas mal de temps, je suis très frustré par rapport à pas mal de distributeurs qui ont l'air de profiter de la culpabilité écologique pour s'en mettre plein les fouilles...

Je prends quelques exemples :

\-les Pasta Box sans fourchette avec un petit logo ""pas de fourchette pour la planète"" qui ont l'air de nous prendre pour des c\*\*\* alors que c'est juste une excuse pour eux d'économiser une partie des frais... Ils ne pourraient pas mettre des couverts en bois responsables dedans ?

\-Les marchés bio qui nous font payer 10 cts le petit sac en papier pour y mettre son pain ! Là j'étais un peu sur le q...

\-Évidemment, les supermarchés qui font payer 40 centimes le grand sac en papier alors qu'ils pourraient proposer des sacs biodégradables qui sont souvent offerts chez les petits commerçants !

Je trouve ça dommage, je vois ces petites choses comme de l'hypocrisie pure de la part du grand C qui nous tapote gentiment l'épaule avec un grand sourire alors qu'il nous fait payer plus en jouant sur les principes écologiques...

1b19b3r,Procédure-bâillon de LDC : L214 fait appel,"
Bonjour 

Le tribunal judiciaire de Strasbourg nous a ordonné de mettre un terme à notre opération de stickage sur les barquettes de poulets Le Gaulois.

Le tribunal estime que le contenu de nos stickers repositionnables dénigre les produits Le Gaulois. L’expression de la discorde : l’emploi des termes « manipulés génétiquement » pour qualifier la sélection génétique outrancière des poulets, qui modifie leur morphotype pour leur faire atteindre 3,5 kg en 45 jours.

Nous appliquons la décision de justice bien sûr, et nous avons mis fin à la diffusion de ces stickers dès jeudi. Mais nous n’en resterons pas là !

# L214 fait appel de la décision

La décision rendue par le tribunal de Strasbourg est une déception. Nous avions soulevé la nécessité de protéger la liberté d’expression de l’association pour pouvoir communiquer sur ces sujets et informer le grand public.

D’autant que LDC ose nous attaquer sur un détail de formulation qui manquerait de rigueur, alors que ce géant de l'agroalimentaire n’hésite pas à mettre en scène des poulets dansant joyeusement le french cancan dans ses publicités, à des années-lumière de la réalité de ce qu’endurent les poulets dans ses élevages.

# Nos actions dérangent le n° 1 de l'élevage intensif

En vérité, peu importe la formulation sur nos stickers, LDC ne souhaite pas que la clientèle et le grand public découvrent les méthodes d’élevage et les souffrances endurées par les poulets.

Nos actions dérangent. Plutôt que de s'engager à bannir les pires pratiques d’élevage, LDC veut nous réduire au silence. Mais nous ne laisserons pas LDC nous intimider et nous empêcher de dévoiler la souffrance des animaux élevés pour ses marques Le Gaulois, Marie et Maître CoQ.

Notre campagne pour mettre un terme aux souffrances aiguës des poulets continue : nous vous donnons rendez-vous très bientôt pour de nouvelles actions !

Les entreprises peuvent faire reculer les souffrances des poulets à grande échelle. Mais n'oubliez pas qu'au niveau individuel, le plus efficace reste de laisser les animaux hors de nos assiettes.

# Se i suv fossero un paese del mondo, sarebbero il quinto per emissioni di CO₂.

Ovvero, gran parte dei risparmi energetici e di emissioni ottenuti grazie alla meravigliosa tecnologia automobilistica, se ne sono andati letteralmente in fumo per produrre auto inutilmente più grosse e inutilmente più potenti, peggiorando la situazione del riscaldamento globale.

Il grafico sopra dimostra due cose: l’ottusità di molti automobilisti, la mala fede dell’industria dell’auto.

**Perché l’ottusità di molti automobilisti?**

1. I suv sono più costosi sia all’acquisto sia per gestione e manutenzione
2. Consumano di più
3. Hanno maggiori punti ciechi che aumentano le possibilità di incidente sia in strada, sia in manovra nei parcheggi
4. Hanno un baricentro più alto, che rende più probabile il ribaltamento e la perdita di aderenza, rendendoli meno sicuri di altri modelli di auto (anche se paradossalmente vengono comprati proprio perché, essendo più grossi, *sembrano* più sicuri…)
5. Sono più pericolosi per gli altri veicoli: avendo maggiore massa, in caso di incidente comportano maggiori danni per veicoli più piccoli, e per i pedoni e i ciclisti.

**Perché la mala fede dell’industria dell’auto?**

Perché le aziende automobilistiche si riempiono la bocca di sostenibilità e minori consumi, mentre contemporaneamente spingono commercialmente i loro modelli più grossi, costosi e affamati di risorse, portando a un generale gigantismo dei veicoli a motore:

[La grottesca crescita del design automobilistico \[galleria fotografica, photo gallery\] \[Aggiornamento\]](https://benzinazero.wordpress.com/2021/03/01/la-grottesca-crescita-del-design-automobilistico/)

Infatti gran parte dei progressi ottenuti dal risparmio energetico dei motori vengono vanificati dalle accresciute dimensioni e peso delle vetture. Inoltre anche dal fatto che l'industria dell'auto cerca di vendere veicoli sempre più grossi per avere maggiori margini di guadagno.

Il tutto con grave danno per l'ambiente e per il clima.

Il 9 aprile 2024, la Corte europea dei diritti umani ha emesso una storica sentenza nel caso Verein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz contro Svizzera. In questo contesto è stato riconosciuto che la Svizzera ha violato l'articolo 8 della CEDU (diritto alla vita privata e familiare) non adottando misure sufficienti per tutelare i cittadini dagli effetti del cambiamento climatico.

II caso dovrebbe però invitarci a riflettere sulla necessità di un nuovo patto sociale tra generazioni per  garantire un pianeta più giusto per coloro che subiranno gli effetti delle nostre scelte.

# Allarme glaciale: la Groenlandia perde i suoi ghiacciai

Gli scienziati hanno scoperto, analizzando le immagini satellitari, che la Groenlandia ha perso 28.707 chilometri quadrati di ghiaccio in tre decenni. Questa è una grande minaccia per la popolazione della Groenlandia. Circa 57.000 persone vivono lì. La maggior parte della popolazione è indigena e molte persone dipendono dagli ecosistemi naturali per la loro sopravvivenza, che ora si stanno rapidamente distruggendo a causa del disgelo.

Il disgelo dei ghiacciai porta al disgelo del permafrost e questo rilascia gas serra come anidride carbonica e metano. Questo causa anche instabilità del terreno, che potrebbe influenzare l’infrastruttura e gli edifici nelle città e nei villaggi.

Michael Grimes, autore principale del rapporto, ha detto: “La perdita di massa glaciale in Groenlandia contribuisce in modo significativo all’aumento globale del livello del mare, e questa tendenza sta creando seri problemi sia ora che in futuro”.

Un gruppo internazionale indipendente di scienziati nel loro studio conferma queste tendenze minacciose. Gli scienziati hanno avvertito che sotto la parte centrale dell’isola dal 1995 si è attivato un focolaio magmatico, che aumenta la velocità del disgelo dei ghiacci indipendentemente dalla stagione.

Il riscaldamento della Groenlandia dall’interno verso l’alto è un chiaro segno dell’aumento dei processi magmatici nelle profondità del pianeta, che influisce sui processi oceanici della regione.

## Il pericolo per la popolazione del pianeta

Questi cambiamenti portano all’insorgere di molti cataclismi in tutto il mondo. Attualmente, il numero di cataclismi sta aumentando in modo esponenziale a causa dell’incremento del riscaldamento nelle profondità della Terra. La caratteristica della crescita esponenziale è che inizialmente la crescita è lenta e quasi impercettibile, ma poi aumenta bruscamente in termini di frequenza, intensità, sincronicità e in molte parti del pianeta.

La crisi climatica è un problema troppo globale e non può essere affrontato da singoli paesi o gruppi di paesi da soli. Perciò gli scienziati lanciano l’allarme e chiedono alla comunità mondiale di unirsi. È importante portare la questione del clima al primo posto ora, perché non possiamo aspettare che l’esponente inizi a salire, quando sarà troppo tardi per cambiare qualcosa.",3,0,2024-04-07 04:40:34,it,cambiamentoclimatico
1brdiat,REPowerEU e transizione giusta,"Con il concetto di “transizione giusta” si intende un approccio equo e inclusivo durante il processo di cambiamento che dovrebbe portare a una società a zero emissioni nette. In altre parole, questo cambiamento non deve essere portato avanti aggravando le condizioni di vulnerabilità dei singoli o delle comunità marginalizzate e non deve aumentare le disuguaglianze sociali e territoriali. 

In Italia il REPowerEU è diventato parte integrante del PNRR attraverso la missione 7, la quale si compone di 22 misure e vede in dotazione un importo complessivo pari a 11 miliardi di euro. Tra le misure possiamo distinguere 5 riforme e 17 investimenti che dovrebbero attuare la strategia italiana per raggiungere obiettivi di sicurezza energetica.

Su due progetti della missione 7 però la stessa Commissione europea ha ritenuto che ci fossero le condizioni per applicare la deroga che prevede la disapplicazione del principio “non arrecare danni significativi"" (Do Not Significant Harm - DNSH) agli obiettivi ambientali e climatici dell’Unione europea sancito dal regolamento UE sulla Tassonomia Ambientale. Tutto questo perché la Commissione ha ritenuto che tali misure rispondono alle esigenze di diversificazione dell’approvvigionamento energetico nell’interesse di tutta l’Unione europea, anche se tali progetti non sono ritenuti in linea con la “transizione verde”.

L’interrogativo che rimane è però quello di capire se questi progetti seguano o meno una logica “market driven” che rischia di escludere persone, comunità o territori dai benefici che potrebbero portare questi progetti mentre dall’altro lato potrebbero costituire un danno al clima e all’ambiente.

A suscitare preoccupazione è proprio la natura strategica del REPowerEU: nella relazione al parlamento si può leggere che “l’abbondanza di disponibilità di fonti di energia rinnovabili nel Sud Italia impone un continuo trasferimento verso il Nord del Paese, dove si concentrano i consumi e dove le interconnessioni con il resto d’Europa sono più strutturate”.

1bmgk86,I “Polmoni della Terra” Sono a Rischio di Estinzione: Gli Ecologisti Lanciano l’Allarme," L’**Amazzonia**, spesso definita “i polmoni del pianeta”, è ora in pericolo. Gli studiosi stimano che nei prossimi decenni dal **10% al 47%** della copertura vegetale attuale dell’Amazzonia sarà soggetto a fattori di stress combinati.

## Il Patrimonio Genetico Mondiale

Il **bacino dell’Amazzonia** è un tesoro di biodiversità. Ospita oltre un milione di specie diverse di piante e animali. Su ogni **10 km² di foresta tropicale**, si trovano:

* **1,500 specie di fiori**
* **750 specie di alberi**
* **125 specie di mammiferi**
* **400 specie di uccelli**
* Innumerevoli invertebrati, molti dei quali ancora non descritti o identificati.

## L’Allarme degli Ecologisti

Gli **ecologisti** sono in allarme. La regione amazzonica è sempre più soggetta a una **pressione senza precedenti** a causa dell’aumento delle temperature, delle forti siccità, della deforestazione e degli incendi, persino nelle aree remote. Uno studio pubblicato sulla rivista scientifica **Nature** ha lanciato un grido d’allarme.

🗣 **Bernardo Flores**, ecologo dell’Università di Santa Catarina in Brasile, ha spiegato: “Una volta superato questo punto di non ritorno, probabilmente non potremo fare nulla. La foresta morirà da sola.” Le siccità e gli incendi in aumento potrebbero trasformare le foreste tropicali in savane.

## Cause Profonde

La causa di questa crisi è attribuita a **cambiamenti nel nucleo della Terra**, all’espansione del pianeta, alla comparsa di crepe e all’ascesa di magma alla crosta terrestre. Questi cambiamenti potrebbero diventare una catastrofe per le comunità indigene e altri che dipendono dalle foreste come risorsa.

☄️ **Purtroppo**, la crisi climatica porta con sé altre crisi: economica, sociale, energetica, ecc. Se non affrontiamo il problema climatico, l’intera umanità sarà sull’orlo della sopravvivenza.

Il 9 febbraio tale accordo avrebbe dovuto essere ratificato dagli Stati Membri attraverso il Consiglio europeo, eppure il voto è stato rinviato per permettere alla presidenza di turno belga di trovare una soluzione all’astensione dichiarata dalla Germania e a quella ventilata dall’Italia.

1ad6coj,STUDIO SU COMPORTAMENTI ALIMENTARI SOSTENBILI E PREOCCUPAZIONI AMBIENTALI," 

ABBIAMO BISOGNO DEL VOSTRO AIUTO!

All'Università di Bologna stiamo conducendo una ricerca sulle abitudini alimentari sostenibili e le preoccupazioni per i cambiamenti climatici che possono influenzare le nostre abitudini alimentari sia in positivo che in negativo.

Condivido qui il link ai questionari di un nuovo progetto di ricerca, ECO-EAT PROJECT, di cui mi sto occupando che ha come obiettivo valutare la relazione tra le preoccupazioni per il cambiamento climatico, disagio e benessere psicologico, e abitudini alimentari, sia sani e sostenibili che disfunzionali e maladaptive.

## In questo articolo di [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-transport) vediamo la distribuzione in percentuale delle emissioni di CO₂ per tipologia di trasporto, sintetizzata nel grafico sopra e così traducibile:

* 45,1% – **Trasporto** **passeggeri** (include auto, motocicli, autobus e taxi)
* 29,4% – **Trasporto merci** su gomma
* 11,6% – **Aviazione** (81% passeggeri, 19% trasporto merci)
* 10,6% – **Trasporto su nave**
* 1% – **Ferrovie**
* 2,2% – Altro (trasporto di petrolio, gas, acqua, vapore e altri materiali in oleodotti, gasdotti eccetera)

Come si vede il trasporto su gomma di passeggeri genera una percentuale molto elevata di CO₂ (e conseguentemente anche di inquinamento, che nell’uso dei combustibili fossili è correlato alla produzione di anidride carbonica), quattro volte superiore al trasporto su nave, che è indispensabile per il commercio internazionale.

Qui l’intero articolo di Our World in Data: [**Cars, planes, trains: where do CO2 emissions from transport come from?**](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-transport)

Un importante buon proposito per il futuro è: ridurre le emissioni dei trasporti, usando meno l’auto privata, comprando meno merci inutili o non necessarie. Non è una scelta pauperistica: il risparmio lo possono e lo devono fare i ricchi e i benestanti, non chi vive con meno di un dollaro al giorno. ◆
